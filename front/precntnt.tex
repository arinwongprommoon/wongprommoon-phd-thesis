%%%% ABSTRACT
\abstract{
    The yeast metabolic cycle (YMC) is a biological rhythm present in budding yeast.
    This biological rhythm is linked to the cell division cycle and entails oscillations in oxygen consumption, intracellular metabolite concentrations, and cellular events.
    Most studies on the YMC have been based on bulk-culture experiments, and the behaviour of the YMC in individual cells is unclear.
    In particular, it is unclear whether such cycles arise from interactions between cells or are generated by individual cells.
    Furthermore, the molecular mechanism of the YMC is unclear.
    I aim to characterise the YMC in single cells and its response to nutrient and genetic perturbations.
    Specifically, I use microfluidics to trap individual yeast cells and record the intensity of flavin fluorescence, a component of the YMC.

    My results show that yeast cells show oscillations in the fluorescence of flavins consistent with the YMC.
    These oscillations coincide with phases of the cell division cycle.
    I found that the metabolic cycle changed its behaviour in respiratory conditions.
    Additionally, I found that cells were able to individually reset the phase of their metabolic cycle, independently of the cell division cycle, in response to abrupt nutrient changes.
    Finally, I showed that deletion strains generated flavin oscillations that exhibited different behaviour from dissolved oxygen oscillations from chemostat conditions, thus warranting a model that reconciles such differences.
