#+title: All Feedback

* Notes
- Based on feedback/all_20230915_448eb8f_DO.pdf

* From DO
- General comment: there is tendency to show figures before they are references, but i suggest you avoid that and put figures after the first time they are mentioned (examples are Figs 1.12-1.14, 3.5-3.6 but there are more). This will also help you to distribute text in between figures, as those subsequent figures (without text in between them) are not such good practice.
- Yes, I think and Figure with an example image and time course alongside would help in Chapter 2.
- I didn’t have problems with 4.5.2.
- Yes Ch 5 is a bit long and I have suggested parts of 5.3 that could be kept or moved to appendix. It’s not terrible long, but you could remove the excess fat.
