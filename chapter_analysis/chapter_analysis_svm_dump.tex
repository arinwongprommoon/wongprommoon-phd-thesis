%----- SC VS SM -----
%I found that \emph{catch22} features have a varied ability to distinguish experimentally relevant groupings in the dataset. %; however, this may be attributed in part to the limitations of the experiments.  % strong link to discussion --> what experiments to do to rectify this
Feature extraction was able to discriminate between cells grown in complete and minimal media.
A linear support vector machine (SVM) trained on the 22-element feature vectors was able to classify the two groups with a mean accuracy of 76.67\%, using 10-fold cross validation.
For comparison, the accuracy of random guessing is 50.00\%.
This classification performance can be shown by a confusion matrix (figure \ref{fig:EffectofMediaCM}), which refers to a contingency table that shows the numbers of instances predicted to belong in each group in rows, and shows the numbers of instances in actual groups in columns.
Furthermore, \texttt{first\-Min\_\-acf} and \texttt{SP\_\-Sum\-ma\-ries\_\-welch\_\-rect\_\-cen\-troid} (table \ref{tab:catch22}) had the greatest linear classifier accuracies.
Cells in minimal media had greater \texttt{first\-Min\_\-acf} values than cells in complete media, and lower \texttt{SP\_\-Sum\-ma\-ries\_\-welch\_\-rect\_\-cen\-troid} values (figure \ref{fig:EffectofMediaTopFeatures}).
These values were consistent with cells in minimal media having longer oscillation periods (figure \ref{fig:catch22validation}).
These results suggest that the period was an important defining feature for the two groups of cells.

%----- EXPOSURE TIME -----
In contrast, \emph{catch22} features performed poorly at discriminating between the three groups defined by flavin LED exposure time (\SI{60}{\milli\second}, \SI{120}{\milli\second}, \SI{180}{\milli\second}) in the set of cells cultured in complete media (SVM: 32.69\% accuracy, figure \ref{fig:FlavinExpostestCM}; accuracy of random guessing is 33.33\%).
% [I'm not sure if I should include this segue to using full-set hctsa.  I didn't mention it in the oscillating vs non-oscillating section.]
%With the full \emph{hctsa} feature set, the 25 features with the greatest mean linear classification accuracy in discriminating groups defined by exposure time were dependent on mean and spread.
%Having features that best distinguish the groups be dependent on mean and spread was consistent with cells subjected to longer exposure times exhibiting flavin signals of higher intensity %(mean raw readings for \SI{60}{\milli\second}: 0.63 AU, \SI{120}{\milli\second}: 1.3 AU, \SI{180}{\milli\second}: 1.7 AU;
%(standard deviations for time series from \SI{60}{\milli\second}: 0.040 AU, \SI{120}{\milli\second}: 0.067 AU, \SI{180}{\milli\second}: 0.085 AU). % is this needed?  is this too detailed?
These findings suggest that exposure time did not affect the characteristics of flavin autofluorescence traces apart from fluorescence intensity.

\end{figure}

%----- OSCILLATING VS NON-OSCILLATING -----

Discrimination between manually-categorised oscillating and non-oscillating flavin autofluorescence traces was also poor (SVM: 66.91\% accuracy, figure \ref{fig:OscillatingCM}; accuracy of random guessing is 50.00\%). %, and using the full \emph{hctsa} feature set was no better (SVM: XX.XX\% accuracy). % Add numbers.  (not sure of violin plots and confusion matrices will be very informative)
These results suggested that using 22 %or even 7700
features across disciplines did not improve on the oscillation classifier (section [INSERT REF HERE]), which was effectively based on one feature, namely, the peak of the normalised classical periodogram.
