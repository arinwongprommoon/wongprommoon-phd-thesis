\chapter{Analysis of oscillatory time series}
\label{ch:analysis}

% Introduction: overview of the 'pipeline'
\section{Overview}
\label{sec:analysis-overview}

% - Zielinski et al. (2014) is a good starting point
% - Titles of the section lends themselves to a punchy opener paragraph that
%   describes the process

\section{Cleaning: choosing data, filtering, missing time points}
\label{sec:analysis-cleaning}

\section{Classification: is my time series oscillatory?}
\label{sec:analysis-classification}

% Literature review subsection
\subsection{Rhythmicity detection for biological data}
\label{subsec:analysis-classification-rhythmicity}
% - Compare and contrast methods
% - Highlight challenges with large datasets of noisy biological data

\subsection{Machine learning approaches to classification}
\label{subsec:analysis-classification-ml}
% Could be useful: Results section of 10-month report

\section{Characterisation: I have one time series -- what properties does it have?}
\label{sec:analysis-characterisation}

% Literature review subsection
\subsection{Periods, phases, amplitudes}
\label{subsec:analysis-characterisation-quantities}

\subsection{Combining methods to get a picture of periodicity}
\label{subsec:analysis-characterisation-combined}

\section{Clustering: I have many time series (of the same signal) from many cells -- what are their relationships to each other?}
\label{sec:analysis-clustering}

% Literature review subsection
\subsection{(Literature)}
\label{subsec:analysis-clustering-literature}

\subsection{Machine learning approaches to clustering}
\label{subsec:analysis-clustering-ml}
% - Featurisation -- decisions to make
% - Clustering approaches and algorithms -- compare and contrast

\section{Correlation: I have two signals from the same cell -- what are their relationships to each other?}
\label{sec:analysis-correlation}
% - Cross-correlation: start from the basic definitions, then extend to population-level cross-correlation as used by Kiviet et al. (2014)

\section{Summary}
\label{sec:analysis-summary}
% - Justification of each steps of my pipeline
