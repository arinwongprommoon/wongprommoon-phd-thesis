Indeed, I found that the method was able to distinguish time series generated in my project from time series obtained by \textcite{baumgartnerFlavinbasedMetabolicCycles2018} (figure \ref{fig:DistanceMatrixBaumgartner}, table \ref{tab:ClusterBaumgartner})
However, this ability to distinguish the data sources may have been because the data from different sources were processed in different ways.

    This distance matrix is based on cosine distances between \textit{catch22} feature vectors for pairs of time series.  Distances between 0 and 1 (legend, right) are represented as colours.}

  \caption{Graph-based clustering is able to partition minimal media time series, complete media time series, and time series from \textcite{baumgartnerFlavinbasedMetabolicCycles2018}.  Table shows one graph partition returned by the general Louvain algorithm.  The graph was constructed according to section [METHODS: HCTSA].  In this case, the default value for the resolution parameter was used.}
