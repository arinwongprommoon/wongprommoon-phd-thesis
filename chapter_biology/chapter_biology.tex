\chapter{Microfluidics and fluorescence microscopy for cellular metabolic cycles}
\label{ch:biology}

To reconcile the evidence about the characteristics of the YMC from single-cell and chemostat experiments, I sought to use a single-cell experimental platform to address whether cellular metabolic cycles confirm chemostat-based studies.

There is a paucity of studies of the yeast metabolic cycle at the cellular level --- i.e.\ in which budding yeast cells are investigated in isolation rather than as a population.
Previous population-level studies in the chemostat, by their very nature, fail to account for cell-to-cell heterogeneity and create cell density and environmental conditions that are far removed from the natural habitat of budding yeast.

Here, I use single-cell microfluidics to physically separate budding yeast cells and use fluorescence microscopy to monitor the yeast metabolic cycle and the cell division cycle.

Specifically, I aim to evaluate these hypotheses:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Yeast cells independently generate yeast metabolic cycles.
        Each cell generates the metabolic cycle autonomously of other cellular oscillators and itself can phase-lock the cell division cycle.
  \item The yeast metabolic cycle is retained in different nutrient and genetic perturbations, but characteristics of the oscillator change as an adaptation response.
  \item Flavin autofluorescence read-outs of the yeast metabolic cycle in single cells recapitulate oscillations in dissolved oxygen from the yeast metabolic cycle in the chemostat.
        If there are discrepancies between the two manifestations of the yeast metabolic cycle, cell-to-cell heterogeneity should explain them.
\end{enumerate}

In this chapter, I showed that metabolic cycles are generated autonomously and are coupled to the cell division cycle in permissive conditions, confirming previous single-cell studies.
To induce decoupling between the two oscillators, confirming the independence and autonomy of the metabolic oscillator, I used fast nutrient switching to induce starvation.
I further showed that the metabolic cycle was robust and adapted to nutrient and genetic perturbations.
Finally, to address whether single-cell metabolic cycles confirm findings from chemostat-based experimental studies, I emulated situations known to affect dissolved-oxygen traces: potassium deficiency, and deletions of genes with roles in metabolic and biological timekeeping.

    }
  \label{fig:biology-htb2}
\end{figure}

To show that metabolic cycles are generated autonomously and are coupled to the cell division cycle, I replicated the single-cell flavin oscillations observed by \textcite{baumgartnerFlavinbasedMetabolicCycles2018} that supported these observations.
Replicating results from a previous flavin-based microfluidics study is important to confirm that the microfluidics set-up I used truly monitored the yeast metabolic cycle, especially if the set-up differed from previous studies \parencite{papagiannakisAutonomousMetabolicOscillations2017, baumgartnerFlavinbasedMetabolicCycles2018}.

Fig.\ \ref{fig:biology-highglc-single} shows that oscillations in flavin fluorescence peak when a bud forms in GS/M, as evidenced by prototrophic FY4 HTB2::mCherry cells grown in minimal medium supplemented with \SI{20}{\gram~\litre^{-1}} glucose.
The HTB2::mCherry insertion allows monitoring phases of the cell division cycle via imaging and quantifying the intensity of the inserted fluorescent protein \parencite{garmendia-torresMultipleInputsEnsure2018}, while also allowing monitoring flavin fluorescence by avoiding overlap of emission spectra.

As observed, oxidation of flavin upon budding was expected for these reasons:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Flavin fluorescence peaks (oxidised form) and NAD(P)H fluorescence peaks (reduced form) at the same time in chemostat cultures \parencite{murrayRedoxRegulationRespiring2011}.
  \item NAD(P)H is in the reduced form when buds form \parencite{papagiannakisAutonomousMetabolicOscillations2017}.
  \item The flavoprotein lipoamide dehydrogenase is in redox equilibrium with NAD(P)H \parencite{sianoNADHFlavinFluorescence1989}.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}

    \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{single_birth_plot_edit.pdf}

    }
  \label{fig:biology-highglc-single}
\end{figure}

Fig.\ \ref{biology-highglc-single} also shows that in some cases, a metabolic oscillation occurred without cell division cycle progression or bud formation.
Such cases, also revealed by \textcite{papagiannakisAutonomousMetabolicOscillations2017} via NAD(P)H cycles, confirmed that the metabolic cycle is generated autonomously from the cell division cycle.

\end{figure}

To quantify the period of the oscillators, I used several time series analysis methods in concert.
Fig.\ \ref{fig:biology-highglc-sync-spectral} shows that the mean Fourier spectrum and median autocorrelation function both suggest that flavin fluorescence oscillated at a period of $\approx$\SI{90}{\minute}.
Fig.\ \ref{fig:biology-highglc-sync-acf} additionally shows that the cell division cycle proceeds at the same frequency, as evidenced by the autocorrelation function of mCherry.
This periodicity agrees with the literature regarding the duration of the cell division cycle in such permissive growth conditions. % [CITATIONS NEEDED]

To visualise the relationship between the metabolic cycle and the cell division cycle,
Fig.\ \ref{fig:biology-highglc-sync-corr} shows that
(a) budding events synchronise with peaks in fluorescence, and
(b) the cell division cycle varies between cells,
but most are just under \SI{2}{\hour}, agreeing with Fig.\ \ref{fig:biology-highglc-sync-acf} (inset).
The oscillatory shape of the median (Fig.\ \ref{fig:biology-highglc-sync-median}) further confirms the synchrony between the metabolic cycle and budding events.

Finally, to quantify the relationship between the metabolic cycle and the cell division cycle, I computed the cross-correlation function between the flavin and mCherry signals across the population (figure~\ref{fig:biology-highglc-sync-xcf}).
This function shows that the mCherry signals are, on average, shifted by \SI{5}{\minute} relative to the flavin signals.


\section[Abrupt nutrient changes]{Cells autonomously generate flavin oscillations, independently of the cell division cycle, in response to abrupt nutrient changes.}
\label{sec:biology-abrupt}

To provide additional evidence that cells generate metabolic oscillations independent of the cell division cycle, I created a condition in which cells do not undergo cell division.
Specifically, I did so by inducing starvation: I cultured FY4 and HTB2::mCherry cells in \SI{7.5}{\gram~\litre^{-1}} glucose for \SI{7}{\hour} before being abruptly switched to \SI{0}{\gram~\litre^{-1}} glucose for \SI{8}{\hour} and then resumed to \SI{7.5}{\gram~\litre^{-1}} glucose for \SI{7}{\hour} (figure~\ref{fig:biology-starvation}).
This abrupt induction of starvation is similar to experiments described by \textcite{bagameryPutativeBetHedgingStrategy2020} that showed the heterogeneity of cellular responses to starvation.

  }
  \label{fig:biology-starvation-gr-budprob}
\end{figure}

Fig.\ \ref{fig:biology-starvation} shows that when cells are in high glucose, oscillations were asynchronous, consistent with section~\ref{sec:biology-sync}, \textcite{papagiannakisAutonomousMetabolicOscillations2017} and \textcite{baumgartnerFlavinbasedMetabolicCycles2018}.
When cells grown in high glucose were abruptly starved of glucose, their flavin oscillations reset phase.
During starvation, these flavin oscillations continue, while growth rate drops and budding events are sparse (figure~\ref{fig:biology-starvation-gr-budprob}).

% Does this paragraph belong in the discussion?
The results show that metabolic oscillations may be generated when cell division cycle is halted, providing strong evidence that the metabolic cycle is generated autonomously and independently of the cell division cycle.
In addition, the results show that each cell can individually reset the phase of its metabolic cycle in response to abrupt changes in environmental conditions; similar phenomena have been observed upon bulk addition of carbon sources \parencite{kuangMsn2RegulateExpression2017, krishnaMinimalPushPull2018}.
Importantly, the results suggest that diffusion of signalling chemicals between cells is not required for generation of metabolic cycles.
Combined with results from the previous section, my results suggest that the metabolic cycle responds to external conditions and create windows of opportunity for initiating the cell division cycle that the cell can choose not to take if conditions are not favourable.

The model in which the metabolic cycle creates windows of opportunity for the cell division cycle implies that, upon starvation, cell division cycles progress to the next gap phase (G1 or G2) while the metabolic cycle continues.
To test this implication, Fig.\ \ref{fig:biology-starvation-raw} shows that cells may remain in G1 (Fig.\ \ref{fig:biology-starvation-raw-2}), as evidenced by low mCherry intensity, or G2 (Fig.\ \ref{fig:biology-stravation-raw-1}), as evidenced by high mCherry intensity.
Extending this investigation across a population of cells, Fig.\ \ref{fig:biology-starvation-heatmap} shows that (INSERT INTERPRETATION OF NEW HEATMAP HERE...).

  \label{fig:biology-by4741-sync}
\end{figure}

To show that the metabolic cycle is robust,
I monitored flavin autofluorescence signals from the auxotrophic BY4741 strain, grown in minimal medium supplemented with uracil and the amino acids required for this strain to grow, plus \SI{10}{\gram~\litre^{-1}} glucose.
Showing that metabolic cycles occur in an auxotroph is important because it shows that many cellular aspects must be impaired for the cycle to disappear, supporting the idea that the metabolic cycle is an intrinsic property of budding yeast.
Similar to FY4 HTB2::mCherry cells, BY4741 cells show robust, consistent oscillations in flavin fluorescence that peak upon budding (figure~\ref{fig:biology-by4741-sync}), although metabolic cycles have a period of $\approx$\SI{75}{\minute} in this case.
The shorter period, implying a higher growth rate, may be explained by a lack of burden caused by a lack of an mCherry insertion, and by media supplements.
% Discussion (probably in discussion section at the end): to be 'proper', I should perform an experiment with the BY4741 HTB2::mCherry I engineered.

\section{Effect of carbon source on YMC}
\label{sec:biology-carbon}

To extend on the idea that the metabolic cycle responds to nutrient conditions and accordingly adjusts the cell's metabolism and cell division cycle, I performed experiments in which I culture cells in pyruvate and in a growth-limiting glucose concentration.
These experiments are important as they confirm conclusions about varying nutrient conditions made by \textcite{papagiannakisAutonomousMetabolicOscillations2017},
% TODO: Fact-check
but using flavin autofluorescence and in additional carbon sources.
Specifically, pyruvate provided an example of a non-fermentable carbon source to test whether the switch from fermentative to respiratory metabolism affected the metabolic cycle.
Additionally, a growth-limiting glucose concentration emulated low-glucose concentrations in a chemostat and was thus used to test whether long YMCs observed in such conditions can be replicated in a microfluidics platform.

\end{figure}

Fig.\ \ref{fig:biology-pyruvate} shows that FY4 HTB2::mCherry cells showed longer metabolic cycles and cell division cycles, of approximately \SI{4}{\hour}, when grown in minimal media supplemented with \SI{20}{\gram~\litre^{-1}} pyruvate.
In addition, there were more cases in which the flavin signal peaks without a budding event (supplementary figure ...).
Furthermore, the synchrony between the two oscillators remained, but with a longer lag of the cell division cycle with respect to the metabolic cycle (Fig.\ ~\ref{fig:biology-pyruvate-xcf}).
Figure~\ref{fig:biology-pyruvate-single} shows that the longer cell division cycles were because of longer G1 phases but unchanged S/M phases, as evidenced by the longer flat regions of the HTB2::mCherry signal.
However, the flavin cycles were not regular over long periods of time, as evidenced by a lack of repeated oscillations in the cross-correlation function.

% COULD DO:
% (Add statistical tests to reject the null hypothesis that the mean duration of metabolic cycles in pyruvate is equal to the mean duration of metabolic cycles in high glucose.  This would depend on having a good number of the duration, and it looks like the inset is the best candidate for this.)

Fig.\ \ref{fig:biology-lowglc} shows that FY4 HTB2::mCherry cells showed longer metabolic cycles when grown in minimal media supplemented with \SI{10}{\milli\gram~\litre^{-1}} glucose.
Additionally, Fig.\ ~\ref{fig:biology-lowglc-gr-budprob} shows that the growth rate and the budding probability of cells on limiting glucose is lower than on high glucose (\SI{20}{\gram~\litre^{-1}}).

Furthermore, Fig.\ \ref{fig:biology-compare-snr} shows that the amplitude of the flavin oscillations in this limiting-glucose condition was low relative to other conditions, as evidenced by the lower signal-to-noise ratios (INSERT: statistical tests to reject the null hypothesis that the distribution of SNRs are the same between the three nutrient conditions.).

Finally, Fig.\ \ref{fig:biology-lowglc-acf} shows that the metabolic cycle and the cell division cycle lost synchrony in limiting glucose.
This was evidenced by a \SI{2.5}{\hour} average metabolic cycle, though not robust, but an absence of consistent oscillations in mCherry intensity.
This decoupling could be explained by a lack of cell division cycle events.

% In contrast to 20 g/L glucose in which metabolic cycles were asynchronous, in these conditions there is some degree of metabolic cycle synchrony between cells. \textbf{(add figures)}

%\section[Potassium-deficient media]{Do single-cell flavin traces recapitulate dissolved-oxygen YMCs in chemostats? -- potassium-deficient media}
\section{Metabolic cycles persist in potassium-deficient media}
\label{sec:biology-potassium_deficient}

To address whether single-cell flavin traces from my microfluidics experiments recapitulate dissolved-oxygen yeast metabolic cycles in chemostats, I replicated conditions of chemostat-based studies that demonstrated nutrient or genetic perturbations that severely affected the metabolic cycle.
These include potassium deficiency along with the zwf1$\Delta$ and tsa1$\Delta$ tsa2$\Delta$ deletions.
This is important in showing that the single-cell metabolic cycle and the chemostat metabolic cycle are the same cycle, or to prove otherwise.
Chemostat experiments obscure the behaviour of individual cells, and
my single-cell microfluidics experiments could provide a bottom-up explanation of high-level observations of the metabolic cycle in the chemostat; for example, whether the cellular behaviour of the yeast metabolic cycle explains the changes in dissolved-oxygen oscillations.

To test whether potassium deficiency eliminates metabolic cycles, Fig.\ \ref{fig:biology-kdeficient-single} shows that FY4 HTB2::mCherry cells retained synchronised metabolic cycles and cell division cycles when cells were abruptly switched from potassium-containing to potassium-deficient minimal medium (both media supplemented with \SI{20}{\gram~\litre^{-1}} as a carbon source).
Such cycles were longer and generated less reliably as in the normal growth medium (figure~\ref{fig:biology-kdeficient-acf}).
In addition, to test whether potassium deficiency affected cell growth and division, Fig.\ \ref{fig:biology-kdeficient-gr} recovered soon after a sharp decrease upon the abrupt switch to the potassium-deficient median.
Fig.\ \ref{fig:biology-kdeficient-budprob} further shows that the budding probability only showed a slight drop during potassium-deficiency, in contrast to a near-zero drop under glucose starvation (figure~\ref{fig:biology-starvation-budprob}).

Results thus suggest that even though there is an initial response to potassium depletion, cells resume growth, division, and generation of metabolic cycles soon after.
My observations show that the metabolic cycle still occur in a drastically changed nutrient condition.
This is in contrast to \textcite{oneillEukaryoticCellBiology2020}, which suggested that as potassium is graduate replaced with sodium in chemostat culture media, the amplitude of dissolved-oxygen oscillations decrease until they disappear altogether (Fig.\ \ref{fig:biology-kdeficient-oneill}).
However, my observations also warrant a model to reconcile the apparent differences between the chemostat and single-cell investigations.

To continue the investigation of whether single-cell flavin-based metabolic cycles recapitulate dissolved-oxygen metabolic cycles, I investigated the zwf1$\Delta$ and tsa1$\Delta$ tsa2$\Delta$ deletion strains.
Deletion strains could give mechanistic insight on the YMC.

To investigate whether the zwf1$\Delta$ strain shows abolition of the metabolic cycle in single-cell microfluidics, I used a zwf1$\Delta$ strain with the BY4741 background.
Chemostat-based studies suggest that in the zwf1$\Delta$ strain, metabolic cycles are abolished but with little change in growth rate \parencite{tuCyclicChangesMetabolic2007}.
% Move to methods?
Cells were pre-cultured in \SI{20}{\gram~\litre^{-1}} pyruvate over \SI{48}{\hour} and then cultured in \SI{10}{\gram~\litre^{-1}} glucose in the microfluidic device as higher glucose concentrations disfavour growth in this strain.
As the strain had an auxotrophic background, the required nutrient supplements were also added.
%
Figure~\ref{fig:biology-zwf1} shows that the zwf$\Delta$ showed oscillations of approximately \SI{3}{\hour}, but with low robustness and a wide distribution of signal-to-noise ratios, while the reference BY4741 strain showed robust flavin oscillations of approximately \SI{1.5}{\hour}.
In addition, Fig.\ \ref{fig:biology-zwf1-snr} shows that there was a wide distribution of oscillation quality.
These results conflict with the results from the chemostat-based study \parencite{tuCyclicChangesMetabolic2007} that suggests that metabolic cycles are abolished in this strain.

\end{figure}


To investigate whether the tsa1$\Delta$ tsa2$\Delta$ strain shows metabolic oscillations of a different waveform in single-cell microfluidics, I used a tsa1$\Delta$ tsa2$\Delta$ strain with the BY4742 background.
Chemostat-based studies suggest that in the tsa1$\Delta$ tsa2$\Delta$ strain, metabolic cycles are shorter and exhibit an M-shaped dissolved oscillation trace due to an additional dip of oxygen consumption in the reductive-charging phase \parencite{caustonMetabolicCyclesYeast2015}.
% Move to methods?
To be consistent with zwf1$\Delta$, cells were pre-cultured and cultured in the same conditions, but with the appropriate supplements for the auxotrophy of BY4742.
%
% Is this because of a wide variety of oscillation frequencies?  Look at the FFT inset, or do additional investigations.

% Figure~\ref{fig:biology-tsa1tsa2} suggests that, despite relatively high-quality oscillations as evidenced by the signal-to-noise ratios, the autocorrelation function does not show oscillations at a regular frequency across the population.
% Although, the median fluorescence signal and Fourier spectra suggest that a \SI{3}{\hour} oscillation is prominent in the population.
% In short, single-cell metabolic oscillations are not reliably generated from the auxotrophic tsa1$\Delta$ tsa2$\Delta$ strain.
% In addition, I also observe cells showing `sick' phenotypes (bloating and clogging) earlier in the experiment than the wild type.

Taken together, there are striking discrepancies between the metabolic cycle observed as dissolved oxygen oscillations from the chemostat and the metabolic cycle observed as flavin autofluorescence oscillations in single-cell conditions in the zwf1$\Delta$ and tsa1$\Delta$ tsa2$\Delta$ deletion strains.
These discrepancies may be partly explained by the lack of information about cell-to-cell heterogeneity in the chemostat.
Chemostat studies commonly state that they induce metabolic cycles by imposing glucose starvation in the culture for some time.
In light of the glucose-starvation results in section~\ref{sec:biology-abrupt}, these metabolic cycles may be the combined effect of individual cells' response to starvation.
A lack of dissolved oxygen oscillations in zwf1$\Delta$ with a growth rate similar to wild-type \parencite{tuCyclicChangesMetabolic2007} may be explained by a loss of ability to reset the phase of the metabolic cycle or a variety of metabolic cycle lengths.
In addition, the M-shaped dissolved oxygen oscillations in tsa1$\Delta$ tsa2$\Delta$ may be explained by the combined effect of sub-populations that have different metabolic cycle periods.
These ideas are additionally supported by how my metabolic cycles are far shorter than the periods of chemostat-based metabolic cycles.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:biology-discussion}

\subsection{Interpretation of results}
\label{subsec:biology-discussion-interpretation}

% TODO:
% - Check whether this recapitulates the hypothesis/aims I presented at the beginning of the chapter.
% - Check how repetitive this is with the main part of the chapter, and kill stuff accordingly.
% - Read the main part as I've come up with some re-interpretations.  The interpretation here must take these into account and also sum them up concisely.

This chapter confirms the presence of flavin-based single-cell metabolic cycles, which are autonomous and gate the cell division cycle.
Consistent with previous single-cell microfluidics studies, in high glucose, flavin cycles are asynchronous between cells and peaks in flavin fluorescence coincide with bud formation.
Results in pyruvate reveal that as the metabolic cycle lengthens, G1 lengthens but S/M stays the same length, reinforcing a model in which a specific phase of the metabolic cycle gates entry into the cell division cycle.
%This is consistent with \textcite{oneillEukaryoticCellBiology2020} and (add other citations here).
Cross-correlation between flavin and mCherry signals further confirm the sequence of events while the two biological oscillations (metabolic cycle and cell division cycle) progress.
This relationship is particularly obvious in pyruvate.
Specifically, when the new bud forms, the mother cell's flavin fluorescence peaks.
Subsequently, the cell synthesises new histones in S phase, then the cell enters anaphase --- characterised by the sharp drop in the mCherry signal --- as the flavin fluorescence is at its trough.
Importantly, metabolic cycles still occur even when cells do not divide.
This holds true for `one-off' skipping of cell division and conditions in which cells pause cell division for long periods of time.

This chapter additionally shows that cells individually generate metabolic cycles and individually adapt them in response to nutrient changes.
The literature disputes whether metabolic oscillations arise from interactions between cells or whether cells individually generate oscillations.
In my observations, even though the cells are physically separated in traps and nutrient media flows through them, single-cell flavin oscillations can synchronise and reset phase in certain conditions.
Diffusible metabolites cannot be responsible.
I thus conclude that each cell --- on its own --- can reset its metabolic cycle in response to nutrient changes.
This conclusion does not mean that cells \emph{cannot} communicate with each other, but communication is \emph{not required}.

Observations of the two oscillators during starvation piques curiosity about their mechanistic basis in such conditions.
% TODO: Come up with new analysis to prove/disprove this.  Or link this with existing results.  It's still quite unclear to me.
For the cell division cycle, the most likely explanation is if starvation occurs before START, cell remain in pause; if starvation occurs after START, cells go into pause.
In contrast, the biochemical mechanism that the cell uses to reset the phase of its metabolic cycle, is unclear, and it owes to the poor characterisation of the biochemistry of the metabolic cycle in general.

This chapter confirms that cells adapt their metabolic cycle to nutrient conditions.
Namely, the behaviour of the metabolic cycle changes when the cells are grown on low glucose or on pyruvate.
The biochemical interpretation could be that nutrient conditions that favour respiration over fermentation --- and thus slower growth rate --- leads to slower YMCs.
% Do the periods conform to those reported by \textcite{papagiannakisAutonomousMetabolicOscillations2017}?  If not, why?

This chapter also attempts to reconcile chemostat and single-cell studies.
In chemostats, glucose is limiting \parencite{jonesCyberneticModelGrowth1999}.
Synchrony of metabolic cycles between cells in respiring conditions may explain observations in chemostat as cells are near glucose starvation in these conditions.

Single-cell metabolic cycles in zwf1$\Delta$ are inconsistent, and this may explain the absence of dissolved-oxygen oscillations in the chemostat.
zwf1$\Delta$ affects many metabolic processes; most notably, it removes a major pathway of NAD(P)H generation from reduction of NAD(P)\textsuperscript{+}.
The most abundant flavoproteins involve NAD(P)H redox, so it is reasonable to believe that flavin oscillations are affected.
Perhaps zwf1$\Delta$ impairs the metabolic cycle in some way.
A similar logic likely applies to tsa1$\Delta$ tsa2$\Delta$ --- perhaps the interaction between a more variable length of metabolic oscillations interacts with population synchrony, or lack thereof, in the chemostat.
Furthermore, the tsa1$\Delta$ tsa2$\Delta$ double deletion affects the peroxiredoxin-thioredoxin system, therefore affecting redox balance, likely in an extensive way.

The fact that metabolic oscillations are present when the medium is potassium-free can be seen as more evidence that there is no straight one-to-one correspondence between dissolved-oxygen metabolic oscillations in the chemostat and single-cell flavin oscillations from single cells.
Therefore, the difference between single-cell and chemostat traces warrant a model to explain the differences, likely involving subpopulations.
My observations thus also highlight a weakness of chemostat experiments.


\subsection{Study caveats and future directions}
\label{subsec:biology-discussion-caveats}

% Worth reading with the introduction to iron out any logical inconsistencies.

\subsubsection{Characteristics of the single-cell metabolic cycle}
\label{subsec:biology-discussion-caveats-characteristics}

Time series of NAD(P)H oscillations, especially if recorded alongside flavin in the same cells, would strengthen the evidence that the flavin autofluorescence oscillations in this chapter are equivalent to the single-cell metabolic oscillations described by previous microfluidics studies.
However, due to technical limitations of the fluorescence microscope and image acquisition set-up, I have not been able to acquire such data.
If I have time series of NAD(P)H oscillations, I would compare the timing of its peaks with that of flavin and budding events to make sure that the sequence of events is consistent with \textcite{papagiannakisAutonomousMetabolicOscillations2017} and \textcite{baumgartnerFlavinbasedMetabolicCycles2018}.
Such data would also provide a novelty: two fluorophores that act as read-outs of the metabolic cycle have, to my knowledge, never been recorded from the same cell.

To explore the link between the components of the flavin signal of the cell and cycling of lipid stores as a proposed biochemical mechanism of the metabolic cycle, the fas1$\Delta$ strain may be studied.
This is a good candidate because \textit{FAS1} codes for the most abundant flavoprotein, the beta subunit of fatty acid synthetase, which happens to have a role in lipid metabolism.
The investigation may be complemented with a rescue experiment using lipid sources such as glycerol trihexanoate or glycerol trioctanoate.
This avenue of exploration may lead to additional insight to the biochemical basis of the yeast metabolic cycle, which is still poorly characterised.

To explore the conditions that make budding yeast cells reset their metabolic cycle phases, future experiments may include adding carbon sources in bulk, using the media-switching system of ALCATRAS.
Such experiments could include acetate, acetaldehyde, or ethanol \parencite{kuangMsn2RegulateExpression2017, krishnaMinimalPushPull2018}.
Insights from such experiments can be combined with that of the glucose-starvation experiment and may lead to a broader understanding of the control of the sequence of events in the metabolic cycle.

\subsubsection{Chemostat vs single-cell}
\label{subsec:biology-discussion-caveats-chemostat}

Further work can be done to address the discrepancies between the chemostat and single-cell microfluidics.
Such work includes analysing sub-populations, additional nutrient conditions, or using different experimental hardwire entirely.

Sub-populations that produce metabolic cycles of different properties likely explain the discrepancy between the chemostat and single-cell microfluidics.
This model is likely for the zwf1$\Delta$ strain: the large spread of signal-to-noise ratios suggest that there can be a group of cells that produce noisy, low-amplitude metabolic cycles and another group that produce higher-quality and more robust metabolic cycles.
In such a case, the time series featurisation and clustering as discussed on the previous chapter may be useful in defining subpopulations, especially with the large datasets I handle,
% There are methods that don't rely on machine learning -- consult notes with Andrew Millar

Low glucose conditions emulate the environmental conditions in the chemostat and may lead to long metabolic cycles, thus explaining why cycles with periods up to \SI{14}{\hour} have been observed.
However, the glucose concentrations in chemostats are below the tolerance of measurement with current technologies, therefore the limiting concentration of \SI{10}{\milli\gram~\litre^{-1}} used in this chapter can be used.
Experiments with deletion strains can then be performed under these low-glucose conditions to investigate whether such conditions lead to a closer equivalence between chemostat and single-cell studies, thus explaining the results from chemostat-based studies of the deletion strains.

% Fact-check this!
Additionally, feast-and-famine conditions have been modelled \parencite{jonesCyberneticModelGrowth1999} and observed \parencite{oneillEukaryoticCellBiology2020} in chemostat cultivation of yeast.
Further experiments can therefore take advantage of the rapid media-switching capabilities of ALCATRAS, and include regular glucose pulsing: cells are fed with a glucose-limited medium for an amount of time, then switched on to the glucose-rich medium for \SI{10}{\minute}, and the cycle repeats.
The interval between glucose pulses can be varied to investigate the effect of an external entraining mechanism on the system of coupled oscillators that defines the yeast metabolic cycle.
This design would be similar to \textcite{charvinForcedPeriodicExpression2009}, which investigated the effect of intervals of glucose pulsing on the cell division and circadian cycles in budding yeast.
A glucose pulsing experiment can thus also lead to an interesting mathematical modelling study.

Finally, a turbidostat can be a middle-ground between chemostat and single-cell experiments and can be used to explore the chemostat-single cell discrepancy.
Turbidostat experiments were not performed due to a lack of hardware and expertise in the research group.
