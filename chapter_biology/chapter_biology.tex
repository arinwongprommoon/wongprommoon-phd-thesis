\subsection{Summary of results}
\label{sec:orgadeecf8}
\begin{itemize}
\item In this study, we show that yeast cells show oscillations in the fluorescence of flavins consistent with the yeast metabolic cycle.  These oscillations synchronise with the cell division cycle in permissive conditions.  Such flavin oscillations exhibited different behaviour in respiratory conditions.  Additionally, we found that cells were able to autonomously reset the phase of their metabolic cycle, independently of the cell division cycle, in response to abrupt nutrient changes.  Finally, we showed that deletion strains generated flavin oscillations that exhibited different behaviour from dissolved oxygen oscillations from chemostat conditions.
\item Our results confirm that the metabolic cycle is an autonomous oscillator, independent of the cell division cycle, and responds to perturbations in the environment\ldots{}
\end{itemize}
