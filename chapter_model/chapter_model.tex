\chapter{Modelling the yeast metabolic cycle}
\label{ch:model}

% - Discuss difficulty of having a fine-grained model: too many unknowns with this biological system
\section{Modelling temporal partitioning of biosynthesis}
\label{sec:model-temporal}
% - Research question: Given a finite amount of enzymes and the nutrient conditions yeast cells are subject to, is it more efficient for the cells to temporally partition synthesis of macromolecules (lipid, carbohydrates, amino acids), or to synthesise all of them at the same time?  If so, does the time scale fit with that of the yeast metabolic cycle?
% - Methods: Flux balance analysis

\section{Modelling chemostat-based studies}
\label{sec:model-chemostat}
% - Metabolic responses to environment
% - Cell communication
% - Relating them to the single-cell yeast metabolic cycle

\section{Coarse-grained, phenomenological model}
