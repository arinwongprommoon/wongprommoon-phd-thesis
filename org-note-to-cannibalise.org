#+title: Org Notes To Cannibalise
* Introduction
** General
- [[id:2904d5dc-8900-4e14-a511-e86ca97e1164][Literature Review Things and Beyond -- Long Note]], [[id:09ae3901-b3e3-4af0-b538-50d8e10052dd][What_we_know_about_metabolic_cycles]] -- though I need to go through it paragraph-by-paragraph (if not line-by-line) for new content as the bulk of the introduction content is already there.  Probably won't bulk up word count, but will refine existing content.
- [[id:6f2ff949-79cc-466a-91ad-5073fe3217ff][Development of Fluorescent Reporters to Measure Metabolic Oscillations in Single Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cells]] -- 'Also might be super useful for writing my thesis, especially the introduction.'
** Yeast metabolic cycle
*** Biological rhythms (other oscillations/broader context)
- [[id:2e7a6d0a-5f09-4d46-8162-5b666b58ba71][glycolytic oscillations]] -- a couple of bullet points.  I think I have a sentence that essentially says this -- need to check for consistency.
- [[cite:&doddLiveCellImaging2017a]]
*** Definition & description
- [[id:2d231a43-61a4-4c38-9c83-62fab840be3a][Mitotic kinase oscillation governs the latching of cell cycle switches]] ([[cite:&novakMitoticKinaseOscillation2022]])
*** Modelling (coupled oscillators)
- [[id:f13dd776-be3b-4717-a964-7fdd5ed9f435][YMC and CDC coupling ratios]] -- table of ratios based on experimental papers.  Useful citations on Arnold tongue.  However, doesn't seem very useful beyond this.
- https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/epdf/10.1142/S0219720020400065 (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3365953.3365956) -- mammalian clock and cell division cycle, observed different coupling ratios, especially under treatment of dexamethasone.  Good as a citation.
- [[cite:&crossModeLockingCell2005]]
- [[id:aacbe724-ae59-401c-bb8b-4bedabe576c5][Ideas_from_different_coupled_oscillators_(2019-10-]]
*** Disputes (chemostat vs single-cell)
- [[id:a2ed5a17-4272-4a5e-b461-570861513cf4][Reconciling chemostat and single-cell studies]] -- _this is a goldmine_.
- [[id:caa6a963-182b-4973-9a93-918e5721e4a6][YMCs_chemostat_vs_single-cell]] -- mostly notes from talking to Kevin, so probably not massively useful is bulking word count.
** Flavin
- [[id:6f1221d4-c198-4494-941d-7780c8eb1b3e][SWAIN_KEVIN_2021-05-03]] -- some ideas on useful flavin reactions, flavin pool, flavoproteins
* Methods
* Analysis
** General
** Characterisation
- [[id:96bf0dac-44dc-4163-87a5-5e9b02f52cd2][MEETING 2022-05-05 Tomasz Zielinski]]
- [[id:dccd3e4a-645a-4f4e-8ea3-92ce46675ca2][MEETING_2022-06-01 Andrew Millar]]
- [[id:0fa47c5c-6d4c-4948-8037-5fe2933f41fc][Test_for_periodocities]]
** Classification
- [[id:c4868d23-6b69-4d78-bcdb-a4037b8b9b1e][Methods to classify oscillations]] -- 'paper idea'
- [[id:55b40a52-0793-4652-b58c-e12172e107ff][Time series classification]] -- good for literature review
- [[id:a2ff4a77-0aec-48ad-97bb-3be2607b9711][catch22]], [[id:2a084f2b-276e-4ed1-9d64-c94dcbfe0467][Catch22: CAnonical Time-series CHaracteristics]]
- [[id:090bb791-8165-426e-81b4-8b12cd72669e][Identifying the most important catch22 features for classification]]
- [[id:3a061286-1111-4d6c-b609-d6767a6e87e4][catch22 and mutual information on Alejandro's dataset]]
- AR
  - Search supervisors' meeting notes for the word 'autoregressive model'
  - (surprisingly badly documented) [[id:59052dc2-c889-4149-931a-5296f3293ae0][Using autoregressive model]], [[id:9194a49e-28b0-4222-836b-ad284c5745fc][Using autoregressive model with a population of cells]]
  - Scour through meeting presentations
- [[id:e4edd764-acc2-4f02-82cd-3252d6f9ed2c][Using SVM with a population of cells]]
** Clustering
- [[id:23d55690-a37a-426b-b11d-d3d155f28c75][UMAP to discover structures in flavin datasets]] -- completely forgot that I did this.  This is more like a tasklist + discussions with Diego & Evangelos.  It does reference some figures, which I haven't attached, so I may have to fish from emails to Diego.
- [[id:6bba292b-d2d2-49e7-92b1-704edaf32d04][Mutual information as similarity for hierarchical rclustering]]
- [[id:f3810173-6909-4e41-bd65-4998c5b4e179][HCTSA_-_literature]], [[id:4a094918-204f-43df-80fd-7a00c5dbe741][HCTSA]],[[id:5525cbdb-38d6-4095-a7a2-8d50dfef9630][2020-06-11 HCTSA crap I plan to do]]
** Cross-correlation
- [[id:5fbe9a08-0d4e-44ed-95db-89ff4cd2ee86][cross-correlation]] -- Literature.  Start from Kiviet et al. -- need to cite them as an example to justify my use.  Also see [[id:edd0cfb3-8af6-498c-bfca-959acab9c89e][Stochasticity of metabolism and growth at the single-cell level]], [[id:53c3666e-30f9-42c8-a357-3181a941954c][Regulatory activity revealed by dynamic correlations in gene expression noise]].  _This is probably the biggest bang for the buck_.
  - [[id:e417e5c4-d1db-4c58-ac0b-be9189763622][autocorrelation]] briefly notes theoretical expectations and [[id:2f8f6205-eaba-4ae4-8e57-34b45820ecc3][Synchronous long-term oscillations in a synthetic gene circuit]] as an example of use across a population.  _May be useful in writing justification for my mathematical methods, which may deviate from the consensus -- BABY paper will be useful too._
- [[id:c75b5b5f-8aab-431a-8450-d4a98cfb43a6][Oscillators with stochastic parameters]] -- I think I haven't added this yet.
* Biological results
** General
- [[id:3c48cc58-77c5-4a27-a968-549f6359bd8d][SWAIN_KEVIN_2020-11-16]] -- swe1, relationship between flavin and redox.  Will be useful for context & discussion of results.
- [[id:2440c6ae-eafb-49e1-8400-af772e2f6702][SWAIN_KEVIN_2021-01-15]] -- small notes on zwf1
- Discussion of hysteresis (history-dependent behaviour)
- Mimicking chemostat and using a 'compromise' concentration.
- Read [[id:afc8d919-cd79-4241-a2fe-1c82376164a0][Redox regulation in respiring Saccharomyces cerevisiae]] to understand redox, for context/discussion.
** Specific results
- [[id:c9936006-8568-473a-bd34-d918859dd11c][Aligning time series to investigate the synchrony of YMCs and CDCs]] -- though maybe it's been subsumed into the publication plan that was the basis for this chapter.  The methods/explanations will be useful though.  Probably won't bulk up word count massively, but will refine existing content.
- [[id:8a208205-716c-48d5-b267-4c4ba59733a5][Effect of glucose concentration and pyruvate on YMC]] -- may have been subsumed into publication plan.  But long discussion, potentially super useful.
** Future direction: feast-and-famine
- Useful citation: [[cite:&charvinForcedPeriodicExpression2009]]
- Some of notes with Kevin deal with this.
* Modelling
- [[id:219ebe74-078e-454e-aa96-8f9719cf06ff][Relevance and Regulation of Cell Density]] -- has a table of proporteion of dry mass of macromolecules, may differ slightly from Grigaitis.
* Misc/Uncategorised
- [[id:a1dd6735-be31-40ee-bf24-767ab4bdcb95][Cell-Cycle Synchronization]]
