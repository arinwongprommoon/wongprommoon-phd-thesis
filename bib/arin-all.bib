  abstract = {Identifying the factors that determine microbial growth rate under various environmental and genetic conditions is a major challenge of systems biology. While current genome-scale metabolic modeling approaches enable us to successfully predict a variety of metabolic phenotypes, including maximal biomass yield, the prediction of actual growth rate is a long standing goal. This gap stems from strictly relying on data regarding reaction stoichiometry and directionality, without accounting for enzyme kinetic considerations. Here we present a novel metabolic network-based approach, MetabOlic Modeling with ENzyme kineTics (MOMENT), which predicts metabolic flux rate and growth rate by utilizing prior data on enzyme turnover rates and enzyme molecular weights, without requiring measurements of nutrient uptake rates. The method is based on an identified design principle of metabolism in which enzymes catalyzing high flux reactions across different media tend to be more efficient in terms of having higher turnover numbers. Extending upon previous attempts to utilize kinetic data in genome-scale metabolic modeling, our approach takes into account the requirement for specific enzyme concentrations for catalyzing predicted metabolic flux rates, considering isozymes, protein complexes, and multi-functional enzymes. MOMENT is shown to significantly improve the prediction accuracy of various metabolic phenotypes in E. coli, including intracellular flux rates and changes in gene expression levels under different growth rates. Most importantly, MOMENT is shown to predict growth rates of E. coli under a diverse set of media that are correlated with experimental measurements, markedly improving upon existing state-of-the art stoichiometric modeling approaches. These results support the view that a physiological bound on cellular enzyme concentrations is a key factor that determines microbial growth rate.},

  abstract = {Cells need to be able to adapt quickly to changes in nutrient availability in their environment in order to survive. Budding yeasts constitute a convenient model to study how eukaryotic cells respond to sudden environmental change because of their fast growth and relative simplicity. Many of the intracellular changes needed for adaptation are spatial and transient; they can be captured experimentally using fluorescence time-lapse microscopy. These data are limited when only used for observation, and become most powerful when they can be used to extract quantitative, dynamic, single-cell information.    In this thesis we describe an analysis framework heavily based on deep learning methods that allows us to quantitatively describe different aspects of cells' response to a new environment from microscopy data. chapter 2 describes a start-to-finish pipeline for data access and preprocessing, cell segmentation, volume and growth rate estimation, and lineage extraction. We provide benchmarks of run time and describe how to speed up analysis using parallelisation. We then show how this pipeline can be extended with custom processing functions, and how it can be used for real-time analysis of microscopy experiments.    In chapter 3 we develop a method for predicting the location of the vacuole and nucleus from bright field images. We combine this method with cell segmentation to quantify the timing of three aspects of the cells' response to a sudden nutrient shift: a transient change in transcription factor nuclear localisation, a change in instantaneous growth rate, and the reorganisation of the plasma membrane through the endocytosis of certain membrane proteins. In particular, we quantify the relative timing of these processes and show that there is a consistent lag between the perception of the stress at the level of gene expression and the reorganisation of the cell membrane.    In chapter 4 we evaluate several methods to obtain cell cycle phase information in a label-free manner. We begin by using the outputs of cell segmentation to predict cytokinesis with high accuracy. We then predict cell cycle phase at a higher granularity directly from bright field images. We show that bright field images contain information about the cell cycle which is not visible by eye. We use these methods to quantify the relationship between cell cycle phase length and growth rate.    Finally, in chapter 5 we look beyond microscopy to the bigger picture. We sketch an abstract description of how, at a genome-scale, cells might choose a strategy for adapting to a nutrient shift based on limited, noisy, and local information. Starting from a constraint-based model of metabolism, we propose an algorithm to navigate through metabolic space using only a lossy encoding of the full metabolic network. We show how this navigation can be used to adapt to a changing environment, and how its results differ from the global optimisation usually applied to metabolic models.},

  abstract = {The cell division cycle in eukaryotic cells is a series of highly coordinated molecular interactions that ensure that cell growth, duplication of genetic material, and actual cell division are precisely orchestrated to give rise to two viable progeny cells. Moreover, the cell cycle machinery is responsible for incorporating information about external cues or internal processes that the cell must keep track of to ensure a coordinated, timely progression of all related processes. This is most pronounced in multicellular organisms, but also a cardinal feature in model organisms such as baker's yeast. The complex and integrative behavior is difficult to grasp and requires mathematical modeling to fully understand the quantitative interplay of the single components within the entire system. Here, we present a self-oscillating mathematical model of the yeast cell cycle that comprises all major cyclins and their main regulators. Furthermore, it accounts for the regulation of the cell cycle machinery by a series of external stimuli such as mating pheromones and changes in osmotic pressure or nutrient quality. We demonstrate how the external perturbations modify the dynamics of cell cycle components and how the cell cycle resumes after adaptation to or relief from stress.},

  abstract = {Control of cell cycle progression by stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs) is essential for cell adaptation to extracellular stimuli. Exposure of yeast to hyperosmotic stress activates the SAPK Hog1, which delays cell cycle progression through G1 by direct phosphorylation of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor Sic1 and by inhibition of the transcription of the genes encoding the G1 cyclins Cln1 and 2. Additional targets of Hog1 may also play a role in this response. We used mathematical modeling and quantitative in vivo experiments to define the contributions of individual components of the G1-S network downstream of Hog1 to this stress-induced delay in the cell cycle. The length of the arrest depended on the degree of stress and the temporal proximity of the onset of the stress to the commitment to cell division, called ``Start.'' Hog1-induced inhibition of the transcription of the gene encoding cyclin Clb5, rather than that of the gene encoding Cln2, prevented entry into S phase upon osmostress. By controlling the accumulation of specific cyclins, Hog1 delayed bud morphogenesis (through Clns) and delayed DNA replication (through Clb5). Hog1-mediated phosphorylation and degradation of Sic1 at Start prevented residual activity of the cyclin/CDK complex Clb5/Cdc28 from initiating DNA replication before adaptation to the stress. Thus, our work defines distinct temporal roles for the actions of Hog1 on Sic1 and cyclins in mediating G1 arrest upon hyperosmotic stress.},

Nevertheless, a characterization of how metabolic fluxes adapt to the changing demands throughout the cell cycle is lacking. Here, we developed a temporal-fluxomics approach to derive a comprehensive and quantitative view of alterations in metabolic fluxes throughout the mammalian cell cycle. This is achieved by combining pulse-chase LC-MS-based isotope tracing in synchronized cell populations with computational deconvolution and metabolic flux modeling. We find that TCA cycle fluxes are rewired as cells progress through the cell cycle with complementary oscillations of glucose versus glutamine-derived fluxes: Oxidation of glucose-derived flux peaks in late G1 phase, while oxidative and reductive glutamine metabolism dominates S phase. These complementary flux oscillations maintain a constant production rate of reducing equivalents and oxidative phosphorylation flux throughout the cell cycle. The shift from glucose to glutamine oxidation in S phase plays an important role in cell cycle progression and cell proliferation.},

  abstract = {The mammalian clock and cell cycle are two essential biological oscillators. In this work we investigate the coupling of these oscillators via non-linear dynamical modeling. We use previously developed reduced models of these systems and study a molecular interaction of MPF (mitosis promoting factor) repression by the CLOCK:BMAL1 protein complex, via induction of the repressor wee1. Furthermore, we propose an hypothesis whereby the clock responds to cell cycle Growth Factors (GFs) via a pathway involving the non-essential cell cycle complex cyclin D/cdk4 and study this interaction in the context of unidirectional clock \textrightarrow{} cell cycle coupling. We observe 1:1, 3:2, 4:3, 5:4 ratios of clock to cell cycle period and identify GF and the coupling strength cb as decisive control parameters for the system's state of synchronization. Synchronization ratios differing from 1:1, namely 3:2 and 5:4, have been observed in cells treated with the corticosteroid Dexamethasone (Dex). Here, we study Dex application and are able to reproduce the induction of ratios differing from 1:1. Finally, because slowing down the cell cycle is very relevant in the context of cancer therapies, we devise particular protocols of cell cycle period control with the use of clock inputs that are successful in substantially slowing down the cell cycle by the use of the system's synchronization dynamics, obtaining 2:3, 3:4, 4:5 ratios of clock to cell cycle period.},

The model links the thermodynamic quantities, such as turgor pressure, osmolarity, cell wall elasto-plasticity, and cell size, applying concepts from rheology and thin shell theory. It reproduces cell size dynamics during single-cell growth, budding, and hyper-osmotic or hypo-osmotic stress. We find that single-cell growth rate and final size are primarily governed by osmolyte uptake and consumption, while bud expansion requires additionally different cell wall extensibilities between mother and bud. Based on first principles the model provides a more accurate description of size dynamics than previous attempts and its analytical simplification allows for easy combination with models for other cell processes.},

Redox cycles persist in the absence of transcription and cyclin-CDK activity, indicating that cells harbor multiple coupled oscillators. Nonetheless, the causal relationships and molecular mechanisms by which redox cycles are embedded within ultradian, circadian or cell division cycles remain largely elusive. Yeast harbor an ultradian oscillator, the yeast metabolic cycle (YMC), which comprises metabolic/redox cycles, transcriptional cycles and synchronized cell division. Here, we reveal the existence of robust cycling of H2O2 and peroxiredoxin oxidation during the YMC and show that peroxiredoxin inactivation disrupts metabolic cycling and abolishes coupling with cell division. We find that thiol-disulfide oxidants and reductants predictably modulate the switching between different YMC metabolic states, which in turn predictably perturbs cell cycle entry and exit. We propose that oscillatory H2O2-dependent protein thiol oxidation is a key regulator of metabolic cycling and its coordination with cell division.},

Membranes isolated from the recombinant strains exhibited reduction of 3-acetylpyridine-NAD+ by NADPH and by NADH in the presence of NADP+, which demonstrated that an active enzyme was present. Unlike the situation in E. coli, however, most of the transhydrogenase activity was not present in the yeast plasma membrane; rather, the enzyme appeared to remain localized in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. During anaerobic glucose fermentation we observed an increase in the formation of 2-oxoglutarate, glycerol, and acetic acid in a strain expressing a high level of transhydrogenase, which indicated that increased NADPH consumption and NADH production occurred. The intracellular concentrations of NADH, NAD+, NADPH, and NADP+were measured in cells expressing transhydrogenase.

Does the system respond preferentially to inputs at certain timescales? These questions are well addressed by the methods of frequency response analysis. In this review, we introduce these methods and outline a procedure for applying this analysis directly to experimental data. This procedure, known as system identification, is a well-established tool in engineering systems and control theory and allows the construction of a predictive dynamic model of a biological system in the absence of any mechanistic details. When studying biochemical and genetic systems, the required experiments are not standard laboratory practice, but with advances in both our ability to measure system outputs (e.g., using fluorescent reporters) and our ability to generate precise inputs (with microfluidic chambers capable of changing cells' environments rapidly and under fine control), these frequency response methods are now experimentally practical for a wide range of biological systems, as evidenced by a number of successful recent applications of these techniques. We use a yeast G-protein signaling cascade as a running example, illustrating both theoretical concepts and practical considerations while keeping mathematical details to a minimum. The review aims to provide the reader with the tools required to design frequency response experiments for their own biological system and the background required to analyze and interpret the resulting data.},

We asked whether this signature is related to a biological function for antisense transcription. Using quantitative RNA-FISH, we observed changes in sense transcript distributions in nuclei and cytoplasm as antisense transcript levels were altered. To determine the mechanistic differences underlying these distributions, we developed a mathematical framework describing transcription from initiation to transcript degradation. At GAL1, high levels of antisense transcription alter sense transcription dynamics, reducing rates of transcript production and processing, while increasing transcript stability. This relationship with transcript stability is also observed as a genome-wide association. Establishing the antisense transcription-associated chromatin signature through disruption of the Set3C histone deacetylase activity is sufficient to similarly change these rates even in the absence of antisense transcription. Thus, antisense transcription alters sense transcription dynamics in a chromatin-dependent manner.},

  abstract = {Circadian rhythms are ubiquitous and are observed in all biological kingdoms. In nature, their primary characteristic or phenotype is the phase of entrainment. There are two main hypotheses related to how circadian clocks entrain, parametric and non-parametric models. The parametric model focuses on the gradual changes of the clock parameters in response to the changing ambient condition, whereas the non-parametric model focuses on the instantaneous change of the phase of the clock in response to the zeitgeber. There are ample empirical data supporting both models. However, only recently has a unifying model been proposed, the circadian integrated response characteristic (CiRC). In the current study, we developed a system of ordinary differential equations, dynamic CiRC (dCiRC), that describes parameters of circadian rhythms and predicts the phase of entrainment in zeitgeber cycles. dCiRC mathematically extracts the underlying information of velocity changes of the internal clock that reflects the parametric model and the phase shift trajectory that reflects the non-parametric model from phase data under entraining conditions. As a proof of concept, we measured clock parameters of 26 Neurospora crassa ecotypes in both cycling and constant conditions using dCiRC. Our data showed that the morning light shortens the period of the clock while the afternoon light lengthens it. We also found that individual ecotypes have different strategies of integrating light effects to accomplish the optimal phase of entrainment, a model feature that is consistent with our knowledge of how circadian clocks are organized and encoded. The unified model dCiRC will provide new insights into how circadian clocks function under different zeitgeber conditions. We suggest that this type of model may be useful in the advent of chronotherapies.},

We analyzed time-series data obtained from the bioenergetic oscillatory outputs of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and isolated cardiomyocytes utilizing Relative Dispersional (RDA) and Power Spectral (PSA) analyses. These analyses revealed broad frequency distributions and evidence for long-term memory in the observed dynamics. Moreover RDA and PSA showed that the bioenergetic dynamics in both systems show fractal scaling over at least 3 orders of magnitude, and that this scaling obeys an inverse power law. Therefore we conclude that in S. cerevisiae and cardiomyocytes the dynamics are scale-free in vivo. Applying RDA and PSA to data generated from an in silico model of mitochondrial function indicated that in yeast and cardiomyocytes the underlying mechanisms regulating the scale-free behavior are similar. We validated this finding in vivo using single cells, and attenuating the activity of the mitochondrial inner membrane anion channel with 4-chlorodiazepam to show that the oscillation of NAD(P)H and reactive oxygen species (ROS) can be abated in these two evolutionarily distant species. Taken together these data strongly support our hypothesis that the generation of ROS, coupled to redox cycling, driven by cytoplasmic and mitochondrial processes, are at the core of the observed rhythmicity and scale-free dynamics. We argue that the operation of scale-free bioenergetic dynamics plays a fundamental role to integrate cellular function, while providing a framework for robust, yet flexible, responses to the environment.},

Mathematical models based on molecular networks, as revealed by experimental data from molecular and genetic studies, have reproduced the oscillatory behavior of CDK activity. Thus, one basic system for representing the CDC is a biochemical oscillator (CDK oscillator). However, genetically clonal cells divide with marked variability in their total duration of a single CDC round, exhibiting non-Gaussian statistical distributions. Therefore, the CDK oscillator model does not account for the statistical nature of cell-cycle control. Herein, we review quantitative studies of the statistical properties of the CDC. Over the past 70 years, studies have shown that the CDC is driven by a cluster of molecular oscillators. The CDK oscillator is coupled to transcriptional and mitochondrial metabolic oscillators, which cause deterministic chaotic dynamics for the CDC. Recent studies in animal embryos have raised the possibility that the dynamics of molecular oscillators underlying CDC control are affected by allometric volume scaling among the cellular compartments. Considering these studies, we discuss the idea that a cluster of molecular oscillators embedded in different cellular compartments coordinates cellular physiology and geometry for successful cell divisions.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY The maintenance of appropriate intracellular concentrations of alkali metal cations, principally K+ and Na+, is of utmost importance for living cells, since they determine cell volume, intracellular pH, and potential across the plasma membrane, among other important cellular parameters. Yeasts have developed a number of strategies to adapt to large variations in the concentrations of these cations in the environment, basically by controlling transport processes. Plasma membrane high-affinity K+ transporters allow intracellular accumulation of this cation even when it is scarce in the environment. Exposure to high concentrations of Na+ can be tolerated due to the existence of an Na+, K+-ATPase and an Na+, K+/H+-antiporter, which contribute to the potassium balance as well. Cations can also be sequestered through various antiporters into intracellular organelles, such as the vacuole. Although some uncertainties still persist, the nature of the major structural components responsible for alkali metal cation fluxes across yeast membranes has been defined within the last 20 years. In contrast, the regulatory components and their interactions are, in many cases, still unclear. Conserved signaling pathways (e.g., calcineurin and HOG) are known to participate in the regulation of influx and efflux processes at the plasma membrane level, even though the molecular details are obscure. Similarly, very little is known about the regulation of organellar transport and homeostasis of alkali metal cations. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date vision of the mechanisms responsible for alkali metal cation transport and their regulation in the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and to establish, when possible, comparisons with other yeasts and higher plants.},

Despite the importance of the products of the TCA cycle for cell viability and proliferation, mammalian cells display diversity in TCA-cycle activity1,2. How this diversity is achieved, and whether it is critical for establishing cell fate, remains poorly understood. Here we identify a non-canonical TCA cycle that is required for changes in cell state. Genetic co-essentiality mapping revealed a cluster of genes that is sufficient to compose a biochemical alternative to the canonical TCA cycle, wherein mitochondrially derived citrate exported to the cytoplasm is metabolized by ATP citrate lyase, ultimately regenerating mitochondrial oxaloacetate to complete this non-canonical TCA cycle. Manipulating the expression of ATP citrate lyase or the canonical TCA-cycle enzyme aconitase 2 in mouse myoblasts and embryonic stem cells revealed that changes in the configuration of the TCA cycle accompany cell fate transitions. During exit from pluripotency, embryonic stem cells switch from canonical to non-canonical TCA-cycle metabolism. Accordingly, blocking the non-canonical TCA cycle prevents cells from exiting pluripotency. These results establish a context-dependent alternative to the traditional TCA cycle and reveal that appropriate TCA-cycle engagement is required for changes in cell state.},

Congruity between simulated and experimental metabolic behavior is influenced by the accuracy of the representation of the metabolic network in the model. In the interest of applying the consensus model of Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolism for increased productivity of triglycerides, we manually evaluated the representation of fatty acid, glycerophospholipid, and glycerolipid metabolism in the consensus model (Yeast v6.0). These areas of metabolism were chosen due to their tightly interconnected nature to triglyceride synthesis. Manual curation was facilitated by custom MATLAB functions that return information contained in the model for reactions associated with genes and metabolites within the stated areas of metabolism. Through manual curation, we have identified inconsistencies between information contained in the model and literature knowledge. These inconsistencies include incorrect gene-reaction associations, improper definition of substrates/products in reactions, inappropriate assignments of reaction directionality, nonfunctional {$\beta$}-oxidation pathways, and missing reactions relevant to the synthesis and degradation of triglycerides. Suggestions to amend these inconsistencies in the Yeast v6.0 model can be implemented through a MATLAB script provided in theSupplementary Materials,Supplementary Data S1(Supplementary Data are available online at www.liebertpub.com/ind).},

We observe two subpopulations of glucose-starved cells: recoverers, which rapidly adapt and resume growth, and arresters, which enter a shock state characterized by deformation of many cellular structures, including mitochondria. These states are heritable, and on high glucose, arresters grow and divide faster than recoverers. Recoverers have a fitness advantage during a carbon source shift but are less fit in a constant, high-glucose environment, and we observe natural variation in the frequency of the two states across wild yeast strains.

Together,  these advances indicate that the future understanding and application of biology  will require the ability to create, parameterise and discriminate between quantitative  models of cellular processes in a rigorous and statistically sound manner.  In this thesis we take the regulation of GAL1 expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a test case and look at all aspects of this process: from reporter selection  to data acquisition and statistical analysis.  In chapter B we will discuss optimal fluorescent reporter selection and construction  for investigating transcriptional dynamics, as well as procedures for quantifying  and correcting the various sources of error in our microscope system.  In chapter 3 we will describe software developed to analyse fluorescent microscopy  images and convert them to gene expression data. A number of iterations of the  software are tested against manually curated data sets, and the measurement  error produced by its imperfections is quantified and discussed.  In chapter 4 a method, based on fluctuations in photobleaching, is developed for  quantifying both measurement error and the relationship between protein concentration and measured fluorescence. The method is refined and its efficacy  discussed.  In the last section I make a preliminary application of these methods to investigating  the regulatory effect of the GAL10-lncRNA. Interesting phenomena are  observed and further investigated using two new strains: genetic variants expressing  a fluorescent reporter from the GAL1 promoter, one harbouring a wild type  GAL1 promoter and one in which the binding site for the Gal10 noncoding RNA  has been removed. The methods developed throughout the thesis are applied and  the data analysed. A heterogeneous response, distinguishable between the two  strains, is observed and related to cell-to-cell variations in growth rate.},

A cell maintains a relatively constant N/C ratio by coupling DNA content, nuclear size, and cell size. We explore how cells couple cell division and growth to DNA content. In some cases, cells use DNA as a molecular yardstick to control the availability of cell cycle regulators. In other cases, DNA sets a limit for biosynthetic capacity. Developmentally programmed variations in the N/C ratio for a given cell type suggest that a specific N/C ratio is required to respond to given physiological demands. Recent observations connecting decreased N/C ratios with cellular senescence indicate that maintaining the proper N/C ratio is essential for proper cellular functioning. Together, these findings suggest a causative, not simply correlative, role for the N/C ratio in regulating cell growth and cell cycle progression.

Elucidating this interplay is crucial for discerning and designing gene regulatory systems. We quantitatively characterized gene-specific and systemic factors that affect transcription and translation genome-wide for Escherichia coli across many conditions. The results revealed two design principles that make regulation of gene expression insulated from concentrations of shared machineries: RNA polymerase activity is fine-tuned to match translational output, and translational characteristics are similar across most messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Consequently, in bacteria, protein concentration is set primarily at the promoter level. A simple mathematical formula relates promoter activities and protein concentrations across growth conditions, enabling quantitative inference of gene regulation from omics data.},

Using time-lapse fluorescence microscopy, we profiled 16 strains of budding yeast, each containing GFP fused to a single gene involved in cell cycle regulation. The dynamics of protein abundance and localization were characterized by extracting the amplitude, period, and other indicators from a series of images. Oscillations of protein abundance could clearly be identified for Cdc15, Clb2, Cln1, Cln2, Mcm1, Net1, Sic1, and Whi5. The period of oscillation of the fluorescently tagged proteins is generally in good agreement with the inter-bud time. The very strong oscillations of Net1 and Mcm1 expression are remarkable since little is known about the temporal expression of these genes. By collecting data from large samples of single cells, we quantified some aspects of cell-to-cell variability due presumably to intrinsic and extrinsic noise affecting the cell cycle.},

The ability to control the cell physicochemical environment by adjusting flow conditions, while performing cellular analysis at single-cell resolution and high-throughput, has made microfluidics the ideal choice to replace traditional in vitro models. However, such a revolution only truly started with the advent of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as a microfluidic structural material and soft-lithography as a rapid manufacturing technology. Indeed, before the ``PDMS age,'' microfluidic technologies were: costly, time-consuming and, more importantly, accessible only to specialized laboratories and users. The simplicity of molding PDMS in various shapes along with its inherent properties (transparency, biocompatibility, and gas permeability) has spread the applications of innovative microfluidic devices to diverse and important biological fields and clinical studies. This review highlights how PDMS-based microfluidic systems are innovating pre-clinical biological research on cells and organs. These devices were able to cultivate different cell lines, enhance the sensitivity and diagnostic effectiveness of numerous cell-based assays by maintaining consistent chemical gradients, utilizing and detecting the smallest number of analytes while being high-throughput. This review will also assist in identifying the pitfalls in current PDMS-based microfluidic systems to facilitate breakthroughs and advancements in healthcare research.},

This systematic experimental approach enables the creation of a statistical model capturing multiple behaviours of CFPS reactions in response to components and their interactions.

  abstract = {Electrosynthesis is a promising approach that enables the biological production of commodities, like fuels and fine chemicals, using renewably produced electricity. Several techniques have been proposed to mediate the transfer of electrons from the cathode to living cells. Of these, the electroproduction of formate as a mediator seems especially promising: formate is readily soluble, of low toxicity and can be produced at relatively high efficiency and at reasonable current density. While organisms that are capable of formatotrophic growth, i.e. growth on formate, exist naturally, they are generally less suitable for bulk cultivation and industrial needs. Hence, it may be helpful to engineer a model organism of industrial relevance, such as E. coli, for growth on formate. There are numerous metabolic pathways that can potentially support formatotrophic growth. Here we analyze these diverse pathways according to various criteria including biomass yield, thermodynamic favorability, chemical motive force, kinetics and the practical challenges posed by their expression. We find that the reductive glycine pathway, composed of the tetrahydrofolate system, the glycine cleavage system, serine hydroxymethyltransferase and serine deaminase, is a promising candidate to support electrosynthesis in E. coli. The approach presented here exemplifies how combining different computational approaches into a systematic analysis methodology provides assistance in redesigning metabolism.

Linear, rather than exponential, accumulation of Whi5, was proposed to provide this coordination by causing a higher Whi5 concentration in cells born at a smaller size. We tested this model using the inducible GAL1 promoter to make the Whi5 concentration independent of cell size. At an expression level that equalizes the mean cell size with that of wild-type cells, the size distributions of cells with galactose-induced Whi5 expression and wild-type cells are indistinguishable. Fluorescence microscopy confirms that the endogenous and GAL1 promoters produce different relationships between Whi5 concentration and cell volume without diminishing size control in the G1 phase. We also expressed Cln3 from the GAL1 promoter, finding that the spread in cell sizes for an asynchronous population is unaffected by this perturbation. Our findings indicate that size control in budding yeast does not fundamentally originate from the linear accumulation of Whi5, contradicting a previous claim and demonstrating the need for further models of cell-cycle regulation to explain how cell size controls passage through Start.},

Systems biology concepts required to pin down `network motifs' or `design principles' for time-dependent processes have been developed for the cell division cycle, through integration of predictive computer modeling with quantitative experimentation. A dynamic coordination of sequential waves of cyclin-dependent kinases (cyclin/Cdk) with the transcription factors network offers insights to investigate how incompatible processes are kept separate in time during the eukaryotic cell cycle. Here this coordination is discussed for the Forkhead transcription factors in light of missing gaps in the current knowledge of cell cycle control in budding yeast. An emergent design principle is proposed where cyclin waves are synchronized by a cyclin/Cdk-mediated feed-forward regulation through the Forkhead as a transcriptional timer. This design is rationalized by the bidirectional interaction between mitotic cyclins and the Forkhead transcriptional timer, resulting in an autonomous oscillator that may be instrumental for a well-timed progression throughout the cell cycle. The regulation centered around the cyclin/Cdk\textendash Forkhead axis can be pivotal to timely coordinate cell cycle dynamics, thereby to actuate the quantitative model of Cdk control.},

  abstract = {Cell division in eukaryotes is achieved via a conserved and tightly controlled protein network. In order to study processes that happen at specific stages during this division cycle it is important to have a culture with synchronized cells. Currently used synchronization methods often use the `arrest-and-release' strategy, in which cells are arrested at a specific point in the cell cycle using chemicals or conditional mutants. Releasing the cells from the arresting conditions results in a synchronized re-entry to the cell cycle. However, these methods usually have severe side-effects on cell physiology and the switching between the restrictive and permissive state is slow. To overcome these limitations, optogenetic systems may be used, as these systems can offer exact molecular control over diverse cellular processes and switching between two states can be achieved rapidly. To identify potential targets for optogenetic control an overview is given of natural existing cell cycle arresting pathways. Two exiting optogenetic systems were identified that utilize these pathways. Since these systems were not designed for cell synchronization, ways to further improve these systems for cell synchronization were discussed. Moreover, two other pathways were identified that showed high potential for cell synchronization. Finally, two papers are discussed that developed systems for direct control of the expression or degradation of key regulators of the cell cycle. Although these systems can potentially invoke less severe side-effects, the arrest is less stringent. Overall, although most optogenetic-based systems would require more optimization to be able to compete with existing cell synchronization methods, these system have the potential to overcome the limitations of the current synchronization methods in the future.},

To address these limitations, we used custom-built microfluidic devices and time-lapse fluorescence microscopy to search for metabolic cycling in the form of endogenous flavin fluorescence in unsynchronized single yeast cells. We uncovered robust and pervasive metabolic cycles that were synchronized with the cell division cycle (CDC) and oscillated across four different nutrient conditions. We then studied the response of these metabolic cycles to chemical and genetic perturbations, showing that their phase synchronization with the CDC can be altered through treatment with rapamycin, and that metabolic cycles continue even in respiratory deficient strains. These results provide a foundation for future studies of the physiological importance of metabolic cycles in processes such as CDC control, metabolic regulation and cell aging.},

Although 2HG has been detected in \emph{Saccharomyces cerevisiae}, its metabolism in yeast has remained largely unexplored. Here, we show that \emph{S. cerevisiae} actively forms the d enantiomer of 2HG. Accordingly, the \emph{S. cerevisiae} genome encodes two homologs of the human d-2HG dehydrogenase: Dld2, which, as its human homolog, is a mitochondrial protein, and the cytosolic protein Dld3. Intriguingly, we found that a \emph{dld3}{$\Delta$} knock-out strain accumulates millimolar levels of d-2HG, whereas a \emph{dld2}{$\Delta$} knock-out strain displayed only very moderate increases in d-2HG. Recombinant Dld2 and Dld3, both currently annotated as d-lactate dehydrogenases, efficiently oxidized d-2HG to {$\alpha$}-ketoglutarate. Depletion of d-lactate levels in the \emph{dld3}{$\Delta$}, but not in the \emph{dld2}{$\Delta$} mutant, led to the discovery of a new type of enzymatic activity, carried by Dld3, to convert d-2HG to {$\alpha$}-ketoglutarate, namely an FAD-dependent transhydrogenase activity using pyruvate as a hydrogen acceptor. We also provide evidence that Ser3 and Ser33, which are primarily known for oxidizing 3-phosphoglycerate in the main serine biosynthesis pathway, in addition reduce {$\alpha$}-ketoglutarate to d-2HG using NADH and represent major intracellular sources of d-2HG in yeast. Based on our observations, we propose that d-2HG is mainly formed and degraded in the cytosol of \emph{S. cerevisiae} cells in a process that couples d-2HG metabolism to the shuttling of reducing equivalents from cytosolic NADH to the mitochondrial respiratory chain via the d-lactate dehydrogenase Dld1.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Reconstructions of cellular metabolism are publicly available for a variety of different microorganisms and some mammalian genomes. To date, these reconstructions are ``genome-scale'' and strive to include all reactions implied by the genome annotation, as well as those with direct experimental evidence. Clearly, many of the reactions in a genome-scale reconstruction will not be active under particular conditions or in a particular cell type. Methods to tailor these comprehensive genome-scale reconstructions into context-specific networks will aid predictive in silico modeling for a particular situation. We present a method called Gene Inactivity Moderated by Metabolism and Expression (GIMME) to achieve this goal. The GIMME algorithm uses quantitative gene expression data and one or more presupposed metabolic objectives to produce the context-specific reconstruction that is most consistent with the available data. Furthermore, the algorithm provides a quantitative inconsistency score indicating how consistent a set of gene expression data is with a particular metabolic objective. We show that this algorithm produces results consistent with biological experiments and intuition for adaptive evolution of bacteria, rational design of metabolic engineering strains, and human skeletal muscle cells. This work represents progress towards producing constraint-based models of metabolism that are specific to the conditions where the expression profiling data is available.},

This standard transformation of non-autonomous vector fields to autonomous is, arguably, of little use in that common techniques for the study of autonomous systems, such as looking for stationary solutions, cannot be applied. This chapter presents alternative ways of transforming a non-autonomous system to autonomous in the special case of periodic forcing, but it also makes the argument that this could be done in other special cases. The argument is inspired by mathematical modelling. Two examples of alternative transformations are given, one in a system of ordinary differential equations and one in a Boolean network.},

A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.}

Here, we devised a microfluidics system to characterize multiple phenotypes in single yeast cells over time before, during, and after salt stress. The system measured cell and colony size, growth rate, and cell-cycle phase along with nuclear trans-localization of two transcription factors: stress-activated Msn2 that regulates defense genes and Dot6 that represses ribosome biogenesis genes during an active stress response. By tracking cells dynamically, we discovered unexpected discordance between Msn2 and Dot6 behavior that revealed subpopulations of cells with distinct growth properties. Surprisingly, post-stress growth recovery was positively corelated with activation of the Dot6 repressor. In contrast, cells lacking Dot6 displayed slower growth acclimation, even though they grow normally in the absence of stress. We show that wild-type cells with a larger Dot6 response display faster production of Msn2-regulated Ctt1 protein, separable from the contribution of Msn2. These results are consistent with the model that transcriptional repression during acute stress in yeast provides a protective response, likely by redirecting translational capacity to induced transcripts.},

It has a unidirectional oxidative part with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase as a key enzyme generating NADPH, and a non-oxidative part involving the reversible transketolase and transaldolase reactions, which interchange PPP metabolites with glycolysis. While the oxidative branch is vital to cope with oxidative stress, the non-oxidative branch provides precursors for the synthesis of nucleic, fatty and aromatic amino acids. For glucose catabolism in the baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where its components were first discovered and extensively studied, the PPP plays only a minor role. In contrast, PPP and glycolysis contribute almost equally to glucose degradation in other yeasts. We here summarize the data available for the PPP enzymes focusing on S. cerevisiae and Kluyveromyces lactis, and describe the phenotypes of gene deletions and the benefits of their overproduction and modification. Reference to other yeasts and to the importance of the PPP in their biotechnological and medical applications is briefly being included. We propose future studies on the PPP in K. lactis to be of special interest for basic science and as a host for the expression of human disease genes.},

The distribution of parent and daughter cells in the population was determined microscopically after staining the bud scars and DNA. Most of the data obtained fits a theoretical population balance model assuming two-classes of subpopulations and integer ratios between the generation times of both classes. Some data has to be described by an extended population model assuming there is one parent and two daughter cell classes. How changes of dilution rate may cause an accidental switch of the mode of oscillation is demonstrated. Glucose consumption and metabolite production were measured off-line by enzymatic methods and gas exchange was monitored on-line. All these data of one period point to internal and external signals responsible for the synchronisation of the cell cycle.},

Here we use single-cell metabolite measurements based on F\"orster resonance energy transfer, combined with computer simulations, to explore the real-time dynamics of the metabolic network of Escherichia coli. We observe that steplike exposure of starved E. coli to glycolytic carbon sources elicits large periodic fluctuations in the intracellular concentration of pyruvate in individual cells. These fluctuations are consistent with predicted oscillatory dynamics of E. coli metabolic network, and they are primarily controlled by biochemical reactions around the pyruvate node. Our results further indicate that fluctuations in glycolysis propagate to other cellular processes, possibly leading to temporal heterogeneity of cellular states within a population.},

Consequently, coupling between such cycles can lead to synchronization. Here, we estimated the mutual interactions between the two oscillators by time-lapse imaging of single mammalian NIH3T3 fibroblasts during several days. The analysis of thousands of circadian cycles in dividing cells clearly indicated that both oscillators tick in a 1:1 mode-locked state, with cell divisions occurring tightly 5~h before the peak in circadian Rev-Erb{$\alpha$}-YFP reporter expression. In principle, such synchrony may be caused by either unidirectional or bidirectional coupling. While gating of cell division by the circadian cycle has been most studied, our data combined with stochastic modeling unambiguously show that the reverse coupling is predominant in NIH3T3 cells. Moreover, temperature, genetic, and pharmacological perturbations showed that the two interacting cellular oscillators adopt a synchronized state that is highly robust over a wide range of parameters. These findings have implications for circadian function in proliferative tissues, including epidermis, immune cells, and cancer.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The ratio of NAD(+)/NADH is a key indicator that reflects the overall redox state of the cells. Until recently, there were no methods for real time NAD(+)/NADH monitoring in living cells. Genetically encoded fluorescent probes for NAD(+)/NADH are fundamentally new approach for studying the NAD(+)/NADH dynamics. METHODS: We developed a genetically encoded probe for the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, NAD(H), redox state changes by inserting circularly permuted YFP into redox sensor T-REX from Thermus aquaticus. We characterized the sensor in vitro using spectrofluorometry and in cultured mammalian cells using confocal fluorescent microscopy. RESULTS: The sensor, named RexYFP, reports changes in the NAD(+)/NADH ratio in different compartments of living cells. Using RexYFP, we were able to track changes in NAD(+)/NADH in cytoplasm and mitochondrial matrix of cells under a variety of conditions. The affinity of the probe enables comparison of NAD(+)/NADH in compartments with low (cytoplasm) and high (mitochondria) NADH concentration. We developed a method of eliminating pH-driven artifacts by normalizing the signal to the signal of the pH sensor with the same chromophore. CONCLUSION: RexYFP is suitable for detecting the NAD(H) redox state in different cellular compartments. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: RexYFP has several advantages over existing NAD(+)/NADH sensors such as smallest size and optimal affinity for different compartments. Our results show that normalizing the signal of the sensor to the pH changes is a good strategy for overcoming pH-induced artifacts in imaging.},

However, there have been no attempts to elucidate how cells' maximum capacity to grow depends on protein availability for different cellular processes. To experimentally address this, we cultivated Saccharomyces cerevisiae in bioreactors with or without amino acid supplementation and performed quantitative proteomics to analyze global changes in proteome allocation, during both anaerobic and aerobic growth on glucose. Analysis of the proteomic data implies that proteome mass is mainly reallocated from amino acid biosynthetic processes into translation, which enables an increased growth rate during supplementation. Similar findings were obtained from both aerobic and anaerobic cultivations. Our findings show that cells can increase their growth rate through increasing its proteome allocation toward the protein translational machinery.},

For this purpose, GC-MS-based metabolic flux ratio analysis was extended from bacteria to the compartmentalized metabolism of S. cerevisiae. Generally, S. cerevisiae was shown to have low catabolic fluxes through the pentose phosphate pathway and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Notably, respiratory TCA cycle fluxes exhibited a strong correlation with the maximum specific growth rate that was attained under different environmental conditions, including a wide range of pH, osmolarity, decoupler and salt concentrations, but not temperature. At pH values of 4{$\cdot$}0 to 6{$\cdot$}0 with near-maximum growth rates, the TCA cycle operated as a bifurcated pathway to fulfil exclusively biosynthetic functions. Increasing or decreasing the pH beyond this physiologically optimal range, however, reduced growth and glucose uptake rates but increased the `cyclic' respiratory mode of TCA cycle operation for catabolism. Thus, the results indicate that glucose repression of the TCA cycle is regulated by the rates of growth or glucose uptake, or signals derived from these. While sensing of extracellular glucose concentrations has a general influence on the in vivo TCA cycle activity, the growth-rate-dependent increase in respiratory TCA cycle activity was independent of glucose sensing.},

It is shown to outperform all other known community detection methods in terms of computation time. Moreover, the quality of the communities detected is very good, as measured by the so-called modularity. This is shown first by identifying language communities in a Belgian mobile phone network of 2 million customers and by analysing a web graph of 118 million nodes and more than one billion links. The accuracy of our algorithm is also verified on ad hoc modular networks.},

  abstract = {The recent trends in ECG device development are heading towards wireless single-lead ECG sensors. The lightweight design of these wireless sensors allows the patients to wear it comfortably for a long period of time and during their ordinary everyday activities. Long-term ECG recordings are intended to help in detection or diagnosis of heart diseases. These measurements are significantly longer and more heterogeneous than the measurements performed at a controlled hospital environment. Consequently, their manual inspection is a tedious, hard and expensive job. An alternative is to use computational techniques for automatic classification of heartbeats and arrhythmia detection. In this paper, we investigate methods for feature extraction in single-lead ECG for the purpose of heartbeat classification. The used feature extraction methods originate from the field of time series analysis. The obtained features are then coupled with a classification algorithm to obtain predictive models. The usefulness of the proposed approach is demonstrated on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. Results show that features that emerge from different scientific areas can provide information for separation of different class distributions that appear in heartbeat classification problem.},

  abstract = {Flavohemoglobins (flavoHbs) are made of a globin domain fused with a ferredoxin reductaselike FAD- and NAD-binding modules. These proteins are widely represented among bacteria and yeasts and represent a most challenging research subject in view of their high reactivity both as reductases and as oxidases. The functional annotations of flavoHbs are still controversial, and different physiological roles that are linked to cell responses to oxidative and/or nitrosative stress have been proposed. The flavoHb from Escherichia coli (HMP) has been the object of a large number of investigations to unveil its physiological role in the framework of bacterial resistance to nitrosative stress. HMP expression has been demonstrated to respond to the presence of NO in the culture medium, and an explicit mechanism has been proposed that involves NO scavenging and its reduction to N2O under anaerobic conditions. In contrast to (or together with) the anaerobic NO-reductase activity, HMP has also been shown to be able to catalyze the oxidation of NO to NO3- (NO-dioxygenase activity) both in vivo and in vitro in the presence of O2 and NADH. HMP has also been shown to be capable of catalyzing the reduction of several alkylhydroperoxide substrates into their corresponding alcohols using NADH as an electron donor. The alkylhydroperoxide reductase activity taken together with the unique lipid-binding properties of HMP suggests that this flavoHb may be involved in the repair of the lipid membrane oxidative damage generated during oxidative/nitrosative stress. \textcopyright{} 2007 IUBMB IUBMB Life, 60(1): 19\textendash 28, 2008},

This can be compared to the information transferred in particular models of the stimulus\textendash response function and to maximum possible information transfer. Such comparisons are crucial because they validate assumptions present in any neurophysiological analysis. Here we review information-theory basics before demonstrating its use in neural coding. We show how to use information theory to validate simple stimulus\textendash response models of neural coding of dynamic stimuli. Because these models require specification of spike timing precision, they can reveal which time scales contain information in neural coding. This approach shows that dynamic stimuli can be encoded efficiently by single neurons and that each spike contributes to information transmission. We argue, however, that the data obtained so far do not suggest a temporal code, in which the placement of spikes relative to each other yields additional information.},

We linked the FPs via a T2A peptide to a control FP, producing equimolar expression of the 2 FPs from 1 plasmid. Using this strategy, we characterised the FPs for brightness, photostability, photochromicity and pH-sensitivity, achieving a comprehensive in vivo characterisation. Many FPs showed different in vivo properties compared to existing in vitro data. Additionally, various FPs were photochromic, which affects readouts due to complex bleaching kinetics. Finally, we codon optimized the best performing FPs for optimal expression in yeast, and found that codon-optimization alters FP characteristics. These FPs improve experimental signal readout, opening new experimental possibilities. Our results may guide future studies in yeast that employ fluorescent proteins.},

  abstract = {Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PPC; EC 4.1.1.31) catalyzes primary nocturnal CO2 fixation in Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) species. CAM PPC is regulated posttranslationally by a circadian clock-controlled protein kinase called phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase kinase (PPCK). PPCK phosphorylates PPC during the dark period, reducing its sensitivity to feedback inhibition by malate and thus enhancing nocturnal CO2 fixation to stored malate. Here, we report the generation and characterization of transgenic RNAi lines of the obligate CAM species Kalancho\"e fedtschenkoi with reduced levels of KfPPCK1 transcripts. Plants with reduced or no detectable dark phosphorylation of PPC displayed up to a 66\% reduction in total dark period CO2 fixation. These perturbations paralleled reduced malate accumulation at dawn and decreased nocturnal starch turnover. Loss of oscillations in the transcript abundance of KfPPCK1 was accompanied by a loss of oscillations in the transcript abundance of many core circadian clock genes, suggesting that perturbing the only known link between CAM and the circadian clock feeds back to perturb the central circadian clock itself. This work shows that clock control of KfPPCK1 prolongs the activity of PPC throughout the dark period in K. fedtschenkoi, optimizing CAM-associated dark CO2 fixation, malate accumulation, CAM productivity, and core circadian clock robustness.},

Entering quiescence enables cells to survive long periods of nondivision and reenter the cell cycle when signaled to do so. Here, we describe what is known about the molecular basis for quiescence in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, with emphasis on the progress made in the last decade. Quiescence is triggered by depletion of an essential nutrient. It begins well before nutrient exhaustion, and there is extensive crosstalk between signaling pathways to ensure that all proliferation-specific activities are stopped when any one essential nutrient is limiting. Every aspect of gene expression is modified to redirect and conserve resources. Chromatin structure and composition change on a global scale, from histone modifications to three-dimensional chromatin structure. Thousands of proteins and RNAs aggregate, forming unique structures with unique fates, and the cytoplasm transitions to a glass-like state.},

Consistent with general translation shutdown, ribosomal proteins contacting the mRNA showed decreased RNA association. Among translation components, RNA association was most reduced for initiation factors involved in 40S scanning (eukaryotic initiation factor 4A [eIF4A], eIF4B, and Ded1), indicating a common mechanism of translational repression. In unstressed cells, eIF4A, eIF4B, and Ded1 primarily targeted the 5{${'}$} ends of mRNAs.

Initiation of autophagy occurs when the Atg1 complex is formed and this process requires the inactivation of the target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1), a master regulator of cell growth and metabolism in all eukaryotes. In budding yeast, TORC1 localizes to two independent pools around the vacuolar membrane and in signaling endosomes juxtaposed to the vacuole. These pools are thought to exist independently of nutrient availability and target unique substrates using regulatory elements that are not well understood. One key upstream regulator of TORC1 is the SEA complex (GATOR complex in humans). The SEA complex is a multimeric eight-protein complex (Iml1/Sea1, Rtc1/Sea2, Mtc5/Sea3, Sea4, Seh1, Sec13, Npr2, Npr3) with both inhibiting and activating TORC1 domains, that resides on the vacuolar membrane. However, despite the discovery of the SEA complex over a decade ago, it is still not well understood. In our recent manuscript, we identified a genetic and functional connection between a novel yeast sorting nexin, Vps501, and the SEA complex.Abbreviations ORF: open reading frame; PX: Phox homology; SEACIT: sea complex inhibitory domain; SNX: Sorting nexin; TORC1: target of rapamycin complex 1},

  abstract = {Circadian omics analyses present investigators with large amounts of data to consider and many choices for methods of analysis. Visualization is crucial as rhythmicity can take many forms and p-values offer an incomplete picture. Yet statically viewing the entirety of high-throughput datasets is impractical, and there is often limited ability to assess the impact of choices, such as significance threshold cutoffs. Nitecap provides an intuitive and unified web-based solution to these problems. Through highly responsive visualizations, Nitecap enables investigators to see dataset-wide behavior. It supports deep analyses, including comparisons of two conditions. Moreover, it focuses upon ease-of-use and enables collaboration through dataset sharing. As an application, we investigated cross talk between peripheral clocks in adipose and liver tissues and determined that adipocyte clock disruption does not substantially modulate the transcriptional rhythmicity of liver but does advance the phase of core clock gene Bmal1 (Arntl) expression in the liver. Nitecap is available at nitecap.org and is free-to-use.},

Based on a piecewise linearization of the dynamics of the mutual CLOCK:BMAL1/PER:CRY inactivation term, we suggest a segmentation of the circadian cycle into six stages, to help analyse different types of synchronization between two clocks, including single stage duration, total period and maximal amplitudes. Finally, our model reproduces some recent experimental results on the effects of different regimes of time-restricted feeding in liver circadian clocks of mice.},

The data are of this form in almost all practical cases of time series analysis as well as in the special case of wavenumber spectral analysis of wave propagation as seen by a linear array of equally spaced sensors.

Here we studied the interaction of two oscillators, the cell division cycle (CDC) and the yeast metabolic cycle (YMC), in budding yeast. Previous work suggested that the CDC and YMC interact to separate high oxygen consumption (HOC) from DNA replication to prevent genetic damage. To test this hypothesis, we grew diverse strains in chemostat and measured DNA replication and oxygen consumption with high temporal resolution at different growth rates. Our data showed that HOC is not strictly separated from DNA replication; rather, cell cycle Start is coupled with the initiation of HOC and catabolism of storage carbohydrates. The logic of this YMC\textendash CDC coupling may be to ensure that DNA replication and cell division occur only when sufficient cellular energy reserves have accumulated. Our results also uncovered a quantitative relationship between CDC period and YMC period across different strains. More generally, our approach shows how studies in genetically diverse strains efficiently identify robust phenotypes and steer the experimentalist away from strain-specific idiosyncrasies.},

A cell must assess its nutritional and metabolic status to ensure it can synthesize sufficient biomass to produce a new daughter cell.

Herein, we discuss the changes in metabolism that accompany entry to, and exit from, the cell cycle for the unicellular eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Studies of budding yeast under continuous, slow-growth conditions have provided insights into the essence of these metabolic changes at unprecedented temporal resolution. Some of these mechanisms by which cell growth and proliferation are coordinated with metabolism are likely to be conserved in multicellular organisms. An improved understanding of the metabolic basis of cell cycle control promises to reveal fundamental principles governing tumorigenesis, metazoan development, niche expansion, and many additional aspects of cell and organismal growth control.},

Strikingly, calcium concentration controls the frequency, but not the duration, of localization bursts. Using an analytic model, we also show that this frequency modulation of bursts ensures proportional expression of multiple target genes across a wide dynamic range of expression levels, independent of promoter characteristics. We experimentally confirm this theory with natural and synthetic Crz1 target promoters. Another stress-response transcription factor, Msn2, exhibits similar, but largely uncorrelated, localization bursts under calcium stress suggesting that frequency-modulation regulation of localization bursts may be a general control strategy used by the cell to coordinate multi-gene responses to external signals.},

  abstract = {Abstract Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) plays important roles in cellular signaling, yet nonetheless is toxic at higher concentrations. Surprisingly, the mechanism(s) of cellular H2O2 toxicity remain poorly understood. Here, we reveal an important role for mitochondrial 1-Cys peroxiredoxin from budding yeast, Prx1, in regulating H2O2-induced cell death. We show that Prx1 efficiently transfers oxidative equivalents from H2O2 to the mitochondrial glutathione pool. Deletion of PRX1 abrogates glutathione oxidation and leads to a cytosolic adaptive response involving upregulation of the catalase, Ctt1. Both of these effects contribute to improved cell viability following an acute H2O2 challenge. By replacing PRX1 with natural and engineered peroxiredoxin variants, we could predictably induce widely differing matrix glutathione responses to H2O2. Therefore, we demonstrated a key role for matrix glutathione oxidation in driving H2O2-induced cell death. Finally, we reveal that hyperoxidation of Prx1 serves as a switch-off mechanism to limit oxidation of matrix glutathione at high H2O2 concentrations. This enables yeast cells to strike a fine balance between H2O2 removal and limitation of matrix glutathione oxidation.},

Cambronne et al. developed a genetically encoded biosensor that can be used to monitor concentrations of free NAD+ in various compartments of a cell (see the Perspective by Guarente). Such concentrations of NAD+ appear to be important in regulating the activity of NAD+-consuming enzymes such as sirtuins and ADP-ribosyltransferases. The authors used the sensor to demonstrate that NAD+ concentrations in mitochondria of cultured human cells can be controlled by multiple mechanisms. Science, this issue p. 1474; see also p. 1396 Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is an essential substrate for sirtuins and poly(adenosine diphosphate\textendash ribose) polymerases (PARPs), which are NAD+-consuming enzymes localized in the nucleus, cytosol, and mitochondria. Fluctuations in NAD+ concentrations within these subcellular compartments are thought to regulate the activity of NAD+-consuming enzymes; however, the challenge in measuring compartmentalized NAD+ in cells has precluded direct evidence for this type of regulation. We describe the development of a genetically encoded fluorescent biosensor for directly monitoring free NAD+ concentrations in subcellular compartments. We found that the concentrations of free NAD+ in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and mitochondria approximate the Michaelis constants for sirtuins and PARPs in their respective compartments. Systematic depletion of enzymes that catalyze the final step of NAD+ biosynthesis revealed cell-specific mechanisms for maintaining mitochondrial NAD+ concentrations. A fluorescent sensor allows measurement of NAD+ concentrations in cultured mammalian cells. A fluorescent sensor allows measurement of NAD+ concentrations in cultured mammalian cells.},

We then demonstrate the procedure in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, using chemostats to generate a large flux/metabolite dataset, under 32 conditions spanning a large range of fluxes. Reactions were classified as pseudo-, near- or far-from-equilibrium, allowing the complexity of mathematical description to be tailored to the kinetic behavior displayed in vivo. For 3/4 of the reactions we derived fully in vivo-parameterized kinetic descriptions which can be readily incorporated into models. For near-equilibrium reactions this involved a new simplified format, dubbed ``Q-linear kinetics''. We also demonstrate, for the first time, systematic estimation of apparent in vivo Keq values. Remarkably, comparison with E. coli data suggests they constitute a suitable in vivo interspecies thermodynamic reference.},

The complexity of these biological systems means that experimental design should often be treated as a multiparametric optimization problem. However, the available methodologies are either impractical, due to a combinatorial explosion in the number of experiments to be performed, or are inaccessible to most experimentalists due to the lack of publicly available, user-friendly software. Although evolutionary algorithms may be employed as alternative approaches to optimize experimental design, the lack of simple-to-use software again restricts their use to specialist practitioners. In addition, the lack of subsidiary approaches to further investigate critical factors and their interactions prevents the full analysis and exploitation of the biotechnological system. We have addressed these problems and, here, provide a simple-to-use and freely available graphical user interface to empower a broad range of experimental biologists to employ complex evolutionary algorithms to optimize their experimental designs. Our approach exploits a Genetic Algorithm to discover the subspace containing the optimal combination of parameters, and Symbolic Regression to construct a model to evaluate the sensitivity of the experiment to each parameter under investigation. We demonstrate the utility of this method using an example in which the culture conditions for the microbial production of a bioactive human protein are optimized.

  abstract = {A major challenge in systems biology is to infer the parameters of regulatory networks that operate in a noisy environment, such as in a single cell. In a stochastic regime it is hard to distinguish noise from the real signal and to infer the noise contribution to the dynamical behavior. When the genetic network displays oscillatory dynamics, it is even harder to infer the parameters that produce the oscillations. To address this issue we introduce a new estimation method built on a combination of stochastic simulations, mass action kinetics and ensemble network simulations in which we match the average periodogram and phase of the model to that of the data. The method is relatively fast (compared to Metropolis-Hastings Monte Carlo Methods), easy to parallelize, applicable to large oscillatory networks and large (\textasciitilde 2000 cells) single cell expression data sets, and it quantifies the noise impact on the observed dynamics. Standard errors of estimated rate coefficients are typically two orders of magnitude smaller than the mean from single cell experiments with on the order of \textasciitilde 1000 cells. We also provide a method to assess the goodness of fit of the stochastic network using the Hilbert phase of single cells. An analysis of phase departures from the null model with no communication between cells is consistent with a hypothesis of Stochastic Resonance describing single cell oscillators. Stochastic Resonance provides a physical mechanism whereby intracellular noise plays a positive role in establishing oscillatory behavior, but may require model parameters, such as rate coefficients, that differ substantially from those extracted at the macroscopic level from measurements on populations of millions of communicating, synchronized cells.},

  abstract = {Heme is an essential protein cofactor used by nearly all forms of life to perform a wide range of tasks, from shuttling electrons to keep photosynthesis running to moving the oxygen we breathe from our lungs throughout our bodies (1). Most of the heme in humans is produced in erythroid cells, which can contain up to 1 billion heme molecules per cell (2). Because free heme that is not bound to proteins is toxic, many students are taught that all heme in erythroid or other cells is bound or being degraded. At best, this picture is incomplete, and, at worst, it obscures fundamental biological questions. One might wonder how bound heme is first loaded into proteins in the various organelles of cells. In addition, new data suggest that unbound or labile heme may be an important signaling molecule (3, 4). Although there have long been tools to study heme structure and synthesis in vitro, as well as tools to study the total heme content in populations of cells, there are few tools to study the dynamics of labile heme in individual, live cells (5). In recent work in PNAS, Hanna et al. (6) develop a new genetically encoded fluorescent sensor for heme, HS1, and uncover the dynamic regulation of resting labile heme, document the mobilization of labile heme in response to NO, and identify glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as a heme buffer in yeast. Traditionally, heme has been studied in cells by homogenizing tissue, acidifying and heating the isolated proteins to release bound heme, and then measuring the fluorescence of the protoporphyrin ring to quantify the concentration of heme from the cells spectroscopically. Such experiments have been useful in identifying changes in heme status by comparing \ldots{}  [{$\carriagereturn$}][1]1To whom correspondence should be addressed.

  abstract = {The Crabtree effect molecular regulation comprehension could help to improve ethanol production with biotechnological purposes and a better understanding of cancer etiology due to its similarity with the Warburg effect. Snf1p/Hxk2p/Mig1p pathway has been linked with the transcriptional regulation of the hexose transporters and phenotypes associated with the Crabtree effect. Nevertheless, direct evidence linking the genetic control of the hexose transporters with modulation of the Crabtree effect phenotypes by the Snf1p/Hxk2p/Mig1p pathway is still lacking. In this sense, we provide evidence that SNF1 and HXK2 genes deletion affects exponential growth, mitochondrial respiration, and transcript levels of hexose transporters in a glucose-dependent manner. The Vmax of the hexose transporters with the high transcript levels was correlated positively with the exponential growth and negatively with the mitochondrial respiration. HXT2 gene transcript levels were the most affected by the deletion of the SNF1/HXK2/MIG1 pathway. Deleting the orthologous genes SNF1 and HXK2 in Kluyveromyces marxianus (Crabtree negative yeast) has an opposite effect compared to Saccharomyces cerevisiae in growth and mitochondrial respiration. Overall, these results indicate that the SNF1/HXK2/MIG1 pathway regulates transcript levels of the hexose transporters, which shows an association with the exponential growth and mitochondrial respiration in a glucose-dependent manner.},

The organising power of these oscillations has not only allowed organisms to anticipate day-night cycles, but also acts to temporally compartmentalise otherwise incompatible processes, enhance metabolic efficiency, make the system more robust to noise and propagate signals among cells. While daily rhythms and the function of the circadian transcription-translation loop have been the subject of extensive research over the past four decades, cycles of shorter period and respiratory oscillations, with which they are intertwined, have received less attention. Here, we describe features of yeast respiratory oscillations, which share many features with daily and 12~hr cellular oscillations in animal cells. This relatively simple system enables the analysis of dynamic rhythmic changes in metabolism, independent of cellular oscillations that are a product of the circadian transcription-translation feedback loop. Knowledge gained from studying ultradian oscillations in yeast will lead to a better understanding of the basic mechanistic principles and evolutionary origins of oscillatory behaviour among eukaryotes.},

Interestingly, past exposure to an environmental condition can shorten the time needed to adapt when the condition re-occurs, even in daughter cells that never directly encountered the initial condition. Here, we use the molecular toolbox of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to systematically unravel the molecular mechanism underlying such history-dependent behavior in transitions between glucose and maltose. In contrast to previous hypotheses, the behavior does not depend on persistence of proteins involved in metabolism of a specific sugar. Instead, presence of glucose induces a gradual decline in the cells' ability to activate respiration, which is needed to metabolize alternative carbon sources. These results reveal how trans-generational transitions in central carbon metabolism generate history-dependent behavior in yeast, and provide a mechanistic framework for similar phenomena in other cell types.},

We report that the disordered region of the~evolutionarily ancient developmental regulator Vts1/Smaug drives self-assembly into gel-like condensates. These proteinaceous particles are not composed of amyloid, yet they are infectious, allowing them to act as a protein-based epigenetic element: a prion [SMAUG+]. In contrast to many amyloid prions, condensation of Vts1 enhances its function in mRNA decay, and its self-assembly properties are conserved over large evolutionary distances. Yeast cells harboring [SMAUG+] downregulate a coherent network of mRNAs and exhibit improved growth under nutrient limitation. Vts1 condensates formed from purified protein can transform naive cells to acquire [SMAUG+]. Our data establish that non-amyloid self-assembly of RNA-binding proteins can drive a form of epigenetics beyond the chromosome, instilling adaptive gene expression programs that are heritable over long biological timescales.},

Above the organismal level, a small number of studies have attempted to artificially select microbial ecosystems, with uneven and generally modest success. Our theoretical understanding of artificial ecosystem selection is limited, particularly for large assemblages of asexual organisms, and we know little about designing efficient methods to direct their evolution. Here, we have developed a flexible modelling framework that allows us to systematically probe any arbitrary selection strategy on any arbitrary set of communities and selected functions. By artificially selecting hundreds of in silico microbial metacommunities under identical conditions, we first show that the main breeding methods used to date, which do not necessarily let communities reach their ecological equilibrium, are outperformed by a simple screen of sufficiently mature communities. We then identify a range of alternative directed evolution strategies that, particularly when applied in combination, are well suited for the top-down engineering of large, diverse and stable microbial consortia. Our results emphasize that directed evolution allows an ecological structure\textendash function landscape to be navigated in search of dynamically stable and ecologically resilient communities with desired quantitative attributes.},

This is critical for correctly predicting growth yields, contrasting multiple models and more importantly modeling microbial communities. However, the standard is rarely verified in the current practice and the chemical formulae of biomass components such as proteins, nucleic acids and lipids are often represented by undefined side groups (e.g. X, R).We introduced a systematic procedure for checking the biomass weight and ensuring complete mass balance of a model. We identified significant departures after examining 64 published models. The biomass weights of 34 models differed by 5\textendash 50\%, while 8 models have discrepancies \&gt;50\%. In total 20 models were manually curated. By maximizing the original versus corrected biomass reactions, flux balance analysis revealed \&gt;10\% differences in growth yields for 12 of the curated models. Biomass MW discrepancies are accentuated in microbial community simulations as they can cause significant and systematic errors in the community composition. Microbes with underestimated biomass MWs are overpredicted in the community whereas microbes with overestimated biomass weights are underpredicted. The observed departures in community composition are disproportionately larger than the discrepancies in the biomass weight estimate. We propose the presented procedure as a standard practice for metabolic reconstructions.The MALTAB and Python scripts are available in the Supplementary Material.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

To empower molecular biologists and researchers in related fields to start using ML for in-depth analyses of their large-scale data, here we provide a summary of fundamental concepts of machine learning, and describe a wide range of research questions and scenarios in molecular biology where ML has been implemented. Due to the abundance of data, reproducibility, and genome-wide coverage, we focus on transcriptomics, and two ML tasks involving it: (a) predicting of transcriptomic profiles or transcription levels from genomic variations in DNA, and (b) predicting phenotypes of interest from transcriptomic profiles or transcription levels. Similar approaches can also be applied to more complex data such as those in multi-omic studies. We envisage that the concepts and examples described here will raise awareness and promote the application of ML among molecular biologists, and eventually help improve a framework for systematic design and predictions of gene expression and phenotypes for synthetic biology applications.},

  abstract = {Phase-locking (frequency entrainment) of an oscillator, in which a periodic extrinsic signal drives oscillations at a frequency different from the unperturbed frequency, is a useful property for study of oscillator stability and structure. The cell cycle is frequently described as a biochemical oscillator; however, because this oscillator is tied to key biological events such as DNA replication and segregation, and to cell growth (cell mass increase), it is unclear whether phase locking is possible for the cell cycle oscillator. We found that forced periodic expression of the G1 cyclin CLN2 phase locks the cell cycle of budding yeast over a range of extrinsic periods in an exponentially growing monolayer culture. We characterize the behavior of cells in a pedigree using a return map to determine the efficiency of entrainment to the externally controlled pulse. We quantify differences between mothers and daughters and how synchronization of an expanding population differs from synchronization of a single oscillator. Mothers only lock intermittently whereas daughters lock completely and in a different period range than mothers. We can explain quantitative features of phase locking in both cell types with an analytically solvable model based on cell size control and how mass is partitioned between mother and daughter cells. A key prediction of this model is that size control can occur not only in G1, but also later in the cell cycle under the appropriate conditions; this prediction is confirmed in our experimental data. Our results provide quantitative insight into how cell size is integrated with the cell cycle oscillator.},

Despite the importance for several production processes, development of an essential dynamic model for central carbon metabolism of Escherichia coli has been severely hampered by the current lack of kinetic information on the dynamics of the metabolic reactions. Here we present the design and experimental validation of such a dynamic model, which, for the first time, links the sugar transport system (i.e., phosphotransferase system [PTS]) with the reactions of glycolysis and the pentose-phosphate pathway. Experimental observations of intracellular concentrations of metabolites and cometabolites at transient conditions are used to validate the structure of the model and to estimate the kinetic parameters. Further analysis of the detailed characteristics of the system offers the possibility of studying important questions regarding the stability and control of metabolic fluxes.},

  abstract = {In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, trehalose-6-phospahte synthase (Tps1) and trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (Tps2) are the main proteins catalyzing intracellular trehalose production. In addition to Tps1 and Tps2, two putative regulatory proteins with less clearly defined roles also appear to be involved with trehalose production, Tps3 and Tsl1. While this pathway has been extensively studied in laboratory strains of S. cerevisiae, we sought to examine the phenotypic consequences of disrupting these genes in wild strains. Here we deleted the TPS1, TPS2, TPS3 and TSL1 genes in four wild strains and one laboratory strain for comparison. Although some tested phenotypes were not shared between all strains, deletion of TPS1 abolished intracellular trehalose, caused inability to grow on fermentable carbon sources and resulted in severe sporulation deficiency for all five strains. After examining tps1 mutant strains expressing catalytically inactive variants of Tps1, our results indicate that Tps1, independent of trehalose production, is a key component for yeast survival in response to heat stress, for regulating sporulation, and growth on fermentable sugars. All tps2{$\Delta$} mutants exhibited growth impairment on non-fermentable carbon sources, whereas variations were observed in trehalose synthesis, thermosensitivity and sporulation efficiency. tps3{$\Delta$} and tsl1{$\Delta$} mutants exhibited mild or no phenotypic disparity from their isogenic wild type although double mutants tps3{$\Delta$} tsl1{$\Delta$} decreased the amount of intracellular trehalose production in all five strains by 17\% - 45\%. Altogether, we evaluated, confirmed, and expanded the phenotypic characteristics associated trehalose biosynthesis mutants. We also identified natural phenotypic variants in multiple strains that could be used to genetically dissect the basis of these traits and then develop mechanistic models connecting trehalose metabolism to diverse cellular processes.},

Various molecular activities oscillate during the cell cycle, with many of them controlled by an oscillating molecular circuit made of CDK/cyclins \textendash{} anaphase promoter complex. However, our group has recently shown in yeast cells that the concentration of some key metabolites oscillates autonomously from the CDK oscillator during the cell cycle. To understand how the metabolic oscillator could interact with the CDK oscillator and regulate cell cycle progression, this thesis applied existing as well as newly developed single-cell tools. In chapter 2, the researcher dynamically shifted nutrient supply for or depleted cell cycle related proteins in single yeast cells and validated a mathematical model where metabolic oscillator is separately coupled to early and late cell cycle components. In chapter 3, the researcher engineered a light-switchable version of a key metabolic enzyme by fusing it with a light-responding protein at computationally predicted sites, for controlling the metabolic oscillator. In Chapter 4, the researcher has probed the activity of a growth-regulating signalling pathway by measuring the localization of a downstream target of this pathway and the concentration of a signalling molecule using fluorescence microscopy. The pathway was found to be oscillating when cells are growing on acetate. Controlling signalling molecule production with a photo-switchable enzyme revealed the pathway's role in cell cycle initiation. Overall, this thesis provides tools and knowledge that will aid further understanding of cell cycle and metabolic oscillator interaction.},

Therefore, a deep understanding of its regulatory mechanisms is necessary for the efficient utilization of nitrogen sources for Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this study, a gene co-expression network was constructed for S. cerevisiae S288C with different nitrogen sources. From this, a key gene co-expression module related to nitrogen source preference utilization was obtained, and 10 hub genes centrally located in the co-expression network were identified. Functional studies verified that the endocytosis-related genes CAP1 and END3 significantly increased the utilization of multiple non-preferred amino acids and reduced the accumulation of the harmful nitrogen metabolite precursor urea by regulating amino acid transporters and TOR pathway. The mitochondria-related gene ATP12, MRPL22, MRP1 and NAM9 significantly increased the utilization of multiple non-preferred amino acids and reduced accumulation of the urea by coordinately regulating nitrogen catabolism repression, Ssy1p-Ptr3p-Ssy5p signaling sensor system, amino acid transporters, TOR pathway and urea metabolism-related pathways. Furthermore, these data revealed the potential positive effects of endocytosis and mitochondrial ribosomes protein translation on nitrogen source preference.

Mathematical modeling, based on biochemical rate equations, provides a rigorous and reliable tool for unraveling the complexities of molecular regulatory networks. The budding yeast cell cycle is a challenging test case for this approach, because the control system is known in exquisite detail and its function is constrained by the phenotypic properties of {$>$}100 genetically engineered strains. We show that a mathematical model built on a consensus picture of this control system is largely successful in explaining the phenotypes of mutants described so far. A few inconsistencies between the model and experiments indicate aspects of the mechanism that require revision. In addition, the model allows one to frame and critique hypotheses about how the division cycle is regulated in wild-type and mutant cells, to predict the phenotypes of new mutant combinations, and to estimate the effective values of biochemical rate constants that are difficult to measure directly in vivo.},

Methods and Results We used a constitutively overexpressed Agt1 transporter to investigate the role of trehalose in the freeze\textendash thaw tolerance of yeast cells by regulating intracellular trehalose concentrations independently of intracellular biosynthesis. Using this method, we found that increasing intracellular trehalose in yeast cells improved cell survival rate after 8 days of freezing at -80 and -20\textdegree C. We also observed that freeze\textendash thaw tolerance promoted by intracellular trehalose only occurs in highly concentrated cell pellets rather than cells in liquid suspension. Conclusions Trehalose is sufficient to provide freeze\textendash thaw tolerance using our Agt1 overexpression system. Freeze\textendash thaw tolerance can be further enhanced by deletion of genes encoding intracellular trehalose degradation enzymes. Significance and Impact of Study These findings are relevant to improving the freeze\textendash thaw tolerance of baker's yeast in the frozen baked goods industry through engineering strains that can accumulate intracellular trehalose via a constitutively expressed trehalose transporter and inclusion of trehalose into the growth medium.},

Single cell RNA sequencing technologies give an opportunity to analyse the cell cycle transcriptome dynamics in an unprecedented range of conditions (cell types and perturbations), with thousands of publicly available datasets. Here we review the main computational tasks in such analysis: 1) identification of cell cycle phases, 2) pseudotime inference, 3) identification and profiling of cell cycle-related genes, 4) removing cell cycle effect, 5) identification and analysis of the G0 (quiescent) cells. We review seventeen software packages that are available today for the cell cycle analysis using scRNA-seq data. Despite huge progress achieved, none of the packages can produce complete and reliable results with respect to all aforementioned tasks. One of the major difficulties for existing packages is distinguishing between two patterns of cell cycle transcriptomic dynamics: normal and characteristic for embryonic stem cells (ESC), with the latter one shared by many cancer cell lines. Moreover, some cell lines are characterized by a mixture of two subpopulations, one following the standard and one ESC-like cell cycle, which makes the analysis even more challenging. In conclusion, we discuss the difficulties of the analysis of cell cycle-related single cell transcriptome and provide certain guidelines for the use of the existing methods.},

This predictive power, achieved with only a few biological parameters, cements the preeminent importance of optimal flux regulation across conditions and establishes low-dimensional allocation models as an ideal physiological framework to interrogate the dynamics of growth, competition, and adaptation in complex and ever-changing environments.},

  abstract = {In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the protein kinase A (PKA) plays a central role in the control of metabolism, stress resistance and cell cycle progression. In a previous work, we used a FRET-based A-kinase activity reporter (AKAR3 probe) to monitor changes in PKA activity in vivo in single S. cerevisiae cells. Since this procedure is quite complex and time-consuming, in this work we used the AKAR3 probe (evenly distributed within the cells) and the plate reader Victor-X3\texttrademark{} (Perkin Elmer\textregistered ) to measure PKA activity in vivo in a whole cell population. We show that in wild type strains, the FRET increases after addition of glucose to glucose-starved cells, while no changes are observed when this sugar is added to strains with either absent or attenuated PKA activity. Moreover, using the pm-AKAR3 probe, mainly expressed at the plasma membrane and partially at the vacuolar membrane, we could monitor PKA activity from the starting site of the signal to internal regions, where the signal is propagated. Finally, we also show evidence for direct activation of PKA by glucose, independent of cAMP. In conclusion, our data show that AKAR3 and pm-AKAR3 probes are useful biosensors to monitor PKA activity in a S. cerevisiae cell population using a plate reader.},

Hydrodynamic flow focusing has been broadly utilized to achieve stream confinement in microchannels for such applications. As imaging flow cytometry gains popularity, the need for imaging-compatible microfluidic devices that allow for precise confinement of single cells in small volumes becomes increasingly important. At the same time, high-throughput single-cell imaging of cell populations produces vast amounts of complex data, which gives rise to the need for versatile algorithms for image analysis. In this work, we present a microfluidics-based platform for single-cell imaging in-flow and subsequent image analysis using variational autoencoders for unsupervised characterization of cellular mixtures. We use simple and robust Y-shaped microfluidic devices and demonstrate precise 3D particle confinement towards the microscope slide for high-resolution imaging. To demonstrate applicability, we use these devices to confine heterogeneous mixtures of yeast species, brightfield-image them in-flow and demonstrate fully unsupervised, as well as few-shot classification of single-cell images with 88\% accuracy.},

We here report that a key determinant of cellular lifespan is not only nutrient supply and intracellular metabolism, but also metabolite exchange interactions that occur between cells. Studying chronological ageing in yeast, we observed that metabolites exported by young, exponentially growing, cells are re- imported during the stationary phase when cells age chronologically, indicating the existence of cross-generational metabolic interactions. We then used self-establishing metabolically cooperating communities (SeMeCos) to boost cell-cell metabolic interactions and observed a significant lifespan extension. A search for the underlying mechanisms, coupling SeMeCos, metabolic profiling, proteomics and genome-scale metabolic modelling, attributed a specific role to methionine consumer cells. These cells were enriched over time, adopted glycolytic metabolism and increased export of protective metabolites. Glycerol, in particular, accumulated in the communal metabolic environment and extended the lifespan of all cells in the community in a paracrine fashion. Our results hence establish metabolite exchange interactions as a determinant of the ageing process and show that metabolically cooperating cells shape their metabolic environment to achieve lifespan extension.},

In particular, nuclear quality control mechanisms and cell cycle checkpoints have generally been studied in young cells and animals where they function optimally, and where genomic instability is low. Here, we use single cell imaging to study the consequences of increased genomic instability during aging, and identify striking age-associated genome missegregation events. During these events the majority of mother cell chromatin, and often both spindle poles, are mistakenly sent to the daughter cell. This breakdown in mitotic fidelity is accompanied by a transient cell cycle arrest that can persist for many hours, as cells engage a retrograde transport mechanism to return chromosomes to the mother cell. The repetitive ribosomal DNA (rDNA) has been previously identified as being highly vulnerable to age-related replication stress and genomic instability, and we present several lines of evidence supporting a model whereby expansion of rDNA during aging results in nucleolar breakdown and competition for limited nucleosomes, thereby increasing risk of catastrophic genome missegregation.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

However, methods that can continuously monitor individual cells at sufficient mass and time resolution hardly exist.

Here, we modify a previously described cell balance (`picobalance') to monitor the proliferation of single cells of the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, under culture conditions in real time. Combined with optical microscopy to monitor the yeast morphology and cell cycle phase, the picobalance approaches a total mass resolution~of 0.45 pg. Our results show that single budding yeast cells (S/G2/M phase) increase total mass in multiple linear segments sequentially, switching their growth rates. The growth rates weakly correlate with the cell mass of the growth segments, and the duration of each growth segment correlates negatively with cell mass. We envision that our technology will be useful for direct, accurate monitoring of the growth of single cells throughout their cycle.},

This focus was elegantly set in motion a decade ago with the design and construction of a genetic toggle switch and an oscillator, with subsequent highlights that have included circuits capable of pattern generation, noise shaping, edge detection and event counting. Here we describe an engineered gene network with global intercellular coupling that is capable of generating synchronized oscillations in a growing population of cells. Using microfluidic devices tailored for cellular populations at differing length scales, we investigate the collective synchronization properties along with spatiotemporal waves occurring at millimetre scales. We use computational modelling to describe quantitatively the observed dependence of the period and amplitude of the bulk oscillations on the flow rate. The synchronized genetic clock sets the stage for the use of microbes in the creation of a macroscopic biosensor with an oscillatory output. Furthermore, it provides a specific model system for the generation of a mechanistic description of emergent coordinated behaviour at the colony level.},

  abstract = {Reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostatic pathways in microbes operate instant and feedback-regulated adjustments of intracellular ROS concentration. They use redox sensors that 'measure' ROS concentration and proportionally set the expression of ROS scavengers. Because of the high sensitivity of these pathways, sensors can be equated to receptors and ROS signals can be equated to agonists.ROS chemistry dictates reactivity towards selective atomic targets in proteins. The hydroxyl radical HO{$\cdot$}is indiscriminate; the superoxide anion O2- is active towards iron\textendash sulphur ([Fe\textendash S]) clusters and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) targets reactive Cys residues. The subcellular colocalization of ROS and their targets contributes to mammalian ROS signalling specificity.Among prokaryotic [Fe\textendash S]-cluster-based sensors, SoxR is O2--specific; both FNR (which senses oxygen) and IscR (which senses [Fe\textendash S]-cluster biosynthesis status) also respond to H2O2 and O2-.Among prokaryotic peroxide sensors, OxyR and OhrR use a reactive Cys residue that oxidizes to a disulphide bond, and PerR uses a non-haem iron centre, the two coordinating His residues of which oxidize to 2-oxo-His.The Hsp33 chaperone and RsrA anti-sigma factor use a Cys\textendash zinc redox centre to respond to a combination of H2O2 and heat (Hsp33) and to diamide (RsrA). Their sensitivity is much lower than that of the ROS receptors.Thiol-based peroxiredoxins and GPX-like peroxidases carry H2O2 receptors and have redox transducing functions. Inactivation by overoxidation and reactivation by sulphiredoxin regulate peroxiredoxin antioxidant functions, H2O2 receptor functions and redox transduction functions.Yeast H2O2 homeostatic pathways use redox relays that comprise a thiol peroxidase as the H2O2 receptor that oxidizes a transcription factor: Yap1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pap1 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe.Instead of ROS homeostatic pathways, mammals use global differentiation programmes, such as those regulated by the tumour-suppressor p53, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-{$\gamma$} (PPAR{$\gamma$}) coactivator-1{$\alpha$}, the oncogene c-Myc and class O forkhead box transcription factors (FOXOs). These pathways provide either long-lasting oxidant-protective responses or cell death as clearance mechanisms for oxidatively damaged cells.The KEAP1\textendash NRF2 pathway constitutes the closest fit to a ROS receptor in mammals, and regulates oxidant and xenobiotic stress-protective responses. Sensing involves a Cys\textendash zinc redox centre.The lack of instant ROS homeostatic control in higher eukaryotes might be the inescapable consequence of using ROS as diffusible signals that modulate multiple intracellular signalling pathways.},

Here we review recent studies that leverage quantitative proteomics to gain insight into in vivo enzyme kinetics. We discuss findings on the relationship between in vivo and in vitro enzyme catalysis and show how proteomics can be used to characterize the efficiency of enzyme utilization across conditions. Lastly, the efficient use of enzymes is shown to rationalize preference for low energy-yield metabolic strategies, such as aerobic fermentation at high growth rate.},

Their role in cellular ageing is under investigation in various model systems. Metabolism of cellular reactive oxygen species is a universal function performed by these organelles. In this study, we investigated alterations in peroxisome number upon early replicative ageing of yeast cells. Increase in the number of peroxisomes in replicatively aged mother cells of wild-type yeast was observed when cultured in both peroxisome-inducing and non-inducing medium. Further, we investigated if this increase in peroxisome number in replicatively aged cells is due to enhanced peroxisome proliferation. For this, the number of peroxisomes in replicatively aged mother cells of pex11, pex25 and pex11pex25 was analysed. Increased percentage of aged cells was observed in pex25 and pex11pex25 cells cultured in peroxisome-inducing oleic acid medium. Interestingly, when cultured in oleic acid, young mother cells devoid of Pex11 showed reduced peroxisome proliferation compared to old mother cells. Induced activity of the antioxidant enzyme catalase and reduced accumulation of reactive oxygen species were reported in all studied strains when cultured in oleic acid medium. Further, our data also suggest that replicatively aged cells with increased peroxisome number also display mitochondrial dysfunction and fragmentation in all the strains studied. In conclusion, our data suggests a correlation between increase in peroxisome number and replicative age of yeast cells and interestingly this increase seems to be partly dependent on the fission proteins.},

  abstract = {Microbes in the wild face highly variable and unpredictable environments and are naturally selected for their average growth rate across environments. Apart from using sensory regulatory systems to adapt in a targeted manner to changing environments, microbes employ bet-hedging strategies where cells in an isogenic population switch stochastically between alternative phenotypes. Yet, bet-hedging suffers from a fundamental trade-off: Increasing the phenotype-switching rate increases the rate at which maladapted cells explore alternative phenotypes but also increases the rate at which cells switch out of a well-adapted state. Consequently, it is currently believed that bet-hedging strategies are effective only when the number of possible phenotypes is limited and when environments last for sufficiently many generations. However, recent experimental results show that gene expression noise generally decreases with growth rate, suggesting that phenotype-switching rates may systematically decrease with growth rate. Such growth rate dependent stability (GRDS) causes cells to be more explorative when maladapted and more phenotypically stable when well-adapted, and we show that GRDS can almost completely overcome the trade-off that limits bet-hedging, allowing for effective adaptation even when environments are diverse and change rapidly. We further show that even a small decrease in switching rates of faster-growing phenotypes can substantially increase long-term fitness of bet-hedging strategies. Together, our results suggest that stochastic strategies may play an even bigger role for microbial adaptation than hitherto appreciated.},

ECHO utilizes an extended solution of the fixed amplitude oscillator that incorporates the amplitude change coefficient. Employing synthetic datasets, we determined that ECHO outperforms existing methods in detecting rhythms with decreasing oscillation amplitudes and in recovering phase shift. Rhythms with changing amplitudes identified from published biological datasets revealed distinct functions from those oscillations that were harmonic, suggesting purposeful biologic regulation to create this subtype of circadian rhythms.ECHO's full interface is available at https://github.com/delosh653/ECHO.

This phenomenon has been named the ``Crabtree effect.'' We used yeast to investigate (i) the short term event(s) associated with the Crabtree effect and (ii) a putative role of hexose phosphates in the inhibition of respiration. Indeed, yeast divide into ``Crabtree-positive,'' where the Crabtree effect occurs, and ``Crabtree-negative,'' where it does not. In mitochondria isolated from these two categories of yeast, we found that low, physiological concentrations of glucose 6-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate slightly (20\%) stimulated the respiratory flux and that this effect was strongly antagonized by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (F16bP). On the other hand, F16bP by itself was able to inhibit mitochondrial respiration only in mitochondria isolated from a Crabtree-positive strain. Using permeabilized spheroplasts from Crabtree-positive yeast, we have shown that the sole effect observed at physiological concentrations of hexose phosphates is an inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation by F16bP. This F16bP-mediated inhibition was also observed in isolated rat liver mitochondria, extending this process to mammalian cells. From these results and taking into account that F16bP is able to accumulate in the cell cytoplasm, we propose that F16bP regulates oxidative phosphorylation and thus participates in the establishment of the Crabtree effect.},

Repeated measurement design in a circadian study is prevalent, in which the same subject is repeatedly measured over time. Several methods are currently available to perform circadian analysis, however, none of them take advantage of the repeated measurement design. And ignoring the within-subject correlation from the repeated measurement could result in lower statistical power. To address this issue, we developed linear mixed model based methods to detect (i) circadian rhythmicity (i.e., Rpt rhythmicity) and (ii) differential circadian patterns comparing two experimental conditions (i.e., Rpt diff). Our model includes a subject-specific random effect, which will account for the within-subject correlation. Via simulations, we showed our method not only could control the type I error rate around the nominal level, but also achieve higher statistical power compared to other methods that cannot model repeated measurement. The superior performance of Rpt rhythmicity and Rpt diff were also demonstrated in two real data applications, including a human restricted feeding data and a human sleep restriction data. An R package for our methods is publicly available on GitHub to promote the application of our methods.},

  abstract = {Flux balance analysis (FBA) and associated techniques operating on stoichiometric genome-scale metabolic models play a central role in quantifying metabolic flows and constraining feasible phenotypes. At the heart of these methods lie two important assumptions: (i) the biomass precursors and energy requirements neither change in response to growth conditions nor environmental/genetic perturbations, and (ii) metabolite production and consumption rates are equal at all times (i.e., steady-state). Despite the stringency of these two assumptions, FBA has been shown to be surprisingly robust at predicting cellular phenotypes. In this paper, we formally assess the impact of these two assumptions on FBA results by quantifying how uncertainty in biomass reaction coefficients, and departures from steady-state due to temporal fluctuations could propagate to FBA results. In the first case, conditional sampling of parameter space is required to re-weigh the biomass reaction so as the molecular weight remains equal to 1~g~mmol-1, and in the second case, metabolite (and elemental) pool conservation must be imposed under temporally varying conditions. Results confirm the importance of enforcing the aforementioned constraints and explain the robustness of FBA biomass yield predictions.},

Glucose addition to immobilized cells induced pH oscillations that could be imaged with fluorescent sensors. A population of cells had oscillations that were heterogeneous in frequency, start time, stop time, duration and amplitude. These changes in cytoplasmic pH were necessary and sufficient to drive changes in NADH. Oscillators had lower mitochondrial membrane potentials and budded more slowly than non-oscillators. We also uncovered a new type of oscillation during recovery from H2O2 challenge. Our data show that pH in S. cerevisiae changes over several time scales, and that imaging pH offers a new way to measure glycolytic oscillations on individual cells.},

  abstract = {The eukaryotic TORC1 kinase assimilates diverse environmental cues, including growth factors and nutrients, to control growth by tuning anabolic and catabolic processes. In yeast, TORC1 stimulates protein synthesis in response to abundant nutrients primarily through its proximal effector kinase Sch9. Conversely, TORC1 inhibition following nutrient limitation unlocks various distally controlled kinases (e.g., Atg1, Gcn2, Npr1, Rim15, Slt2/Mpk1, and Yak1), which cooperate through poorly defined circuits to orchestrate the quiescence program. To better define the signaling landscape of the latter kinases, we use in~vivo quantitative phosphoproteomics. Through pinpointing known and uncharted Npr1, Rim15, Slt2/Mpk1, and Yak1 effectors, our study examines the architecture of the distally controlled TORC1 kinase network. Accordingly, this is built on a combination of discrete, convergent, and multilayered feedback regulatory mechanisms, which likely ensure homeostatic control of and/or robust responses by TORC1 and its effector kinases under fluctuating nutritional conditions.},

  abstract = {Genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) have been widely used for quantitative exploration of the relation between genotype and phenotype. Streamlined integration of enzyme constraints and proteomics data into such models was first enabled by the GECKO toolbox, allowing the study of phenotypes constrained by protein limitations. Here, we upgrade the toolbox in order to enhance models with enzyme and proteomics constraints for any organism with a compatible GEM reconstruction. With this, enzyme-constrained models for the budding yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Yarrowia lipolytica and Kluyveromyces marxianus are generated to study their long-term adaptation to several stress factors by incorporation of proteomics data. Predictions reveal that upregulation and high saturation of enzymes in amino acid metabolism are common across organisms and conditions, suggesting the relevance of metabolic robustness in contrast to optimal protein utilization as a cellular objective for microbial growth under stress and nutrient-limited conditions. The functionality of GECKO is expanded with an automated framework for continuous and version-controlled update of enzyme-constrained GEMs, also producing such models for Escherichia coli and Homo sapiens. In this work, we facilitate the utilization of enzyme-constrained GEMs in basic science, metabolic engineering and synthetic biology purposes.},

  abstract = {Feature engineering plays a vital role in big data analytics. Machine learning and data mining algorithms cannot work without data. Little can be achieved if there are few features to represent the underlying data objects, and the quality of results of those algorithms largely depends on the quality of the available features. Feature Engineering for Machine Learning and Data Analytics provides a comprehensive introduction to feature engineering, including feature generation, feature extraction, feature transformation, feature selection, and feature analysis and evaluation.  The book presents key concepts, methods, examples, and applications, as well as chapters on feature engineering for major data types such as texts, images, sequences, time series, graphs, streaming data, software engineering data, Twitter data, and social media data. It also contains generic feature generation approaches, as well as methods for generating tried-and-tested, hand-crafted, domain-specific features. The first chapter defines the concepts of features and feature engineering, offers an overview of the book, and provides pointers to topics not covered in this book. The next six chapters are devoted to feature engineering, including feature generation for specific data types. The subsequent four chapters cover generic approaches for feature engineering, namely feature selection, feature transformation based feature engineering, deep learning based feature engineering, and pattern based feature generation and engineering. The last three chapters discuss feature engineering for social bot detection, software management, and Twitter-based applications respectively. This book can be used as a reference for data analysts, big data scientists, data preprocessing workers, project managers, project developers, prediction modelers, professors, researchers, graduate students, and upper level undergraduate students. It can also be used as the primary text for courses on feature engineering, or as a supplement for courses on machine learning, data mining, and big data analytics.},

We explore the usage of Graph Convolutional Neural Networks coupled with dropout and gene embeddings to utilize the graph information. We find this approach provides an advantage for particular tasks in a low data regime but is very dependent on the quality of the graph used.

To better understand how cells respond to dynamically interacting factors, we quantified the effects of dual fluctuations of osmotic stress and glucose deprivation on yeast cells using microfluidics and time-lapse microscopy. Strikingly, we observed that cell proliferation, survival and signaling depend on the phasing of the two periodic stresses. Cells divided faster, survived longer and showed decreased transcriptional response when fluctuations of hyperosmotic stress and glucose deprivation occurred in phase than when the two stresses occurred alternatively. We also found that mutants with impaired osmotic stress response were better adapted to alternating stresses than wild-type cells, showing that genetic mechanisms of adaptation to a persistent stress factor can be detrimental under dynamically interacting conditions. Taken together, we demonstrate that glucose availability regulates yeast responses to dynamic osmotic stress. We anticipate that our approach can be extended to other stress responsive pathways to further elucidate the key role of metabolic fluctuations in the dynamics of cellular responses to stress.},

  abstract = {Background COnstraint-Based Reconstruction and Analysis (COBRA) methods are widely used for genome-scale modeling of metabolic networks in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Due to the successes with metabolism, there is an increasing effort to apply COBRA methods to reconstruct and analyze integrated models of cellular processes. The COBRA Toolbox for MATLAB is a leading software package for genome-scale analysis of metabolism; however, it was not designed to elegantly capture the complexity inherent in integrated biological networks and lacks an integration framework for the multiomics data used in systems biology. The openCOBRA Project is a community effort to promote constraints-based research through the distribution of freely available software. Results Here, we describe COBRA for Python (COBRApy), a Python package that provides support for basic COBRA methods. COBRApy is designed in an object-oriented fashion that facilitates the representation of the complex biological processes of metabolism and gene expression. COBRApy does not require MATLAB to function; however, it includes an interface to the COBRA Toolbox for MATLAB to facilitate use of legacy codes. For improved performance, COBRApy includes parallel processing support for computationally intensive processes. Conclusion COBRApy is an object-oriented framework designed to meet the computational challenges associated with the next generation of stoichiometric constraint-based models and high-density omics data sets.

This study demonstrates that these redox cycles are conserved in all domains of life, including Bacteria, Archaea and Eukaryota, pointing to the possibility that this type of cellular timekeeping has co-evolved with redox homeostatic mechanisms across organisms for billions of years.

Known clock circuits include multiple, interlocked feedback loops. Theory suggested that multiple loops contribute the flexibility for molecular rhythms to track multiple phases of the external cycle. Clear dawn- and dusk-tracking rhythms illustrate the flexibility of timing in Ipomoea nil. Molecular clock components in Arabidopsis thaliana showed complex, photoperiod-dependent regulation, which was analysed by comparison with three contrasting models. A simple, quantitative measure, Dusk Sensitivity, was introduced to compare the behaviour of clock models with varying loop complexity. Evening-expressed clock genes showed photoperiod-dependent dusk sensitivity, as predicted by the three-loop model, whereas the one- and two-loop models tracked dawn and dusk, respectively. Output genes for starch degradation achieved dusk-tracking expression through light regulation, rather than a dusk-tracking rhythm. Model analysis predicted which biochemical processes could be manipulated to extend dusk tracking. Our results reveal how an operating principle of biological regulators applies specifically to the plant circadian clock.},

These metabolic oscillations, called the Yeast Metabolic Cycle, are important for understanding how changes in metabolism might dysregulate the cell division cycle, as seen in cancer, or affect product yield by industrial yeast strains. To date, most research has relied on techniques that measure the average change in metabolic activity or gene expression across a population in a bioreactor. These bulk measurements obscure dynamics in potential subpopulations and individual cells. New insights should come from studying the Yeast Metabolic Cycle and its interaction with the cell division cycle in single cells. The purpose of my research has been to develop reporters of metabolic state and cell cycle state in single cells of budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. First, I created a yeast strain with GFP fused to Ura7, a CTP synthase. Using fluorescent microscopy, I showed that the dynamic signal produced by the fluorescent Ura7 enzyme structures is a potential reporter of the Yeast Metabolic Cycle phase in single yeast cells. Then, I created another strain with TdTomato fused to Whi5, a repressor of cell cycle entry. This strain failed to produce sustained metabolic oscillations, and I will discuss possible reasons why. Last, I used another strain with a temperature sensitive allele of the master regulator of the cell cycle, Cdc28, to argue that metabolic oscillations persist in the absence of the cell cycle.},

  abstract = {Networks of interacting biomolecules carry out many essential functions in living cells1, but the `design principles' underlying the functioning of such intracellular networks remain poorly understood, despite intensive efforts including quantitative analysis of relatively simple systems2. Here we present a complementary approach to this problem: the design and construction of a synthetic network to implement a particular function. We used three transcriptional repressor systems that are not part of any natural biological clock3,4,5 to build an oscillating network, termed the repressilator, in Escherichia coli. The network periodically induces the synthesis of green fluorescent protein as a readout of its state in individual cells. The resulting oscillations, with typical periods of hours, are slower than the cell-division cycle, so the state of the oscillator has to be transmitted from generation to generation. This artificial clock displays noisy behaviour, possibly because of stochastic fluctuations of its components. Such `rational network design' may lead both to the engineering of new cellular behaviours and to an improved understanding of naturally occurring networks.},

  abstract = {When conditions change, unicellular organisms rewire their metabolism to sustain cell maintenance and cellular growth. Such rewiring may be understood as resource re-allocation under cellular constraints. Eukaryal cells contain metabolically active organelles such as mitochondria, competing for cytosolic space and resources, and the nature of the relevant cellular constraints remain to be determined for such cells. Here, we present a comprehensive metabolic model of the yeast cell, based on its full metabolic reaction network extended with protein synthesis and degradation reactions. The model predicts metabolic fluxes and corresponding protein expression by constraining compartment-specific protein pools and maximising growth rate. Comparing model predictions with quantitative experimental data suggests that under glucose limitation, a mitochondrial constraint limits growth at the onset of ethanol formation\textemdash known as the Crabtree effect. Under sugar excess, however, a constraint on total cytosolic volume dictates overflow metabolism. Our comprehensive model thus identifies condition-dependent and compartment-specific constraints that can explain metabolic strategies and protein expression profiles from growth rate optimisation, providing a framework to understand metabolic adaptation in eukaryal cells.},

It phosphorylates several key proteins to control progression through the different phases of the cell cycle. However, studies conducted several decades ago with mammalian cells revealed that Cdk1 also directly regulates the basal transcription machinery, most notably RNA polymerase II. More recent studies in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have revisited this function of Cdk1 and also revealed that Cdk1 directly controls RNA polymerase III activity. These studies have also provided novel insight into the physiological relevance of this process. For instance, cell cycle-stage-dependent activity of these complexes may be important for meeting the increased demand for various proteins involved in housekeeping, metabolism, and protein synthesis. Recent work also indicates that direct regulation of the RNA polymerase II machinery promotes cell cycle entry. Here, we provide an overview of the regulation of basal transcription by Cdk1, and we hypothesize that the original function of the primordial cell-cycle CDK was to regulate RNAPII and that it later evolved into specialized kinases that govern various aspects of the transcription machinery and the cell cycle.},

This allowed the generation of a collection of mutants for each of the approximately 6000 open reading frames (ORFs) within the S. cerevisiae genome. The deletion cassettes can be amplified by polymerase chain reaction from the respective deletion mutant, so that the deletion can be easily introduced into any S. cerevisiae strain of interest. Currently, deletion mutants for about 5900 genes are available from the various S. cerevisiae strain collections. In addition, an increasing number of strains and plasmids can be received where genes are under regulated expression, have affinity tags for easy purification of the respective protein, and are fused to the green fluorescence protein for their easy cellular localization.},

We then establish, using 37 real concentration-flux relationships across both organisms, that in~vivo {$\Delta$}G{$\circ\geq-$}4 kJ/mol is the threshold above which substrates are likely to be sensitive to upstream flux(es).},

This coordination is mediated by extensive cross-talk between nutrient signaling, metabolism, growth, and the cell division cycle, which is only gradually being uncovered: Nutrient signaling not only controls entry into the cell cycle at the G1/S transition, but all phases of the cell cycle. Metabolites are even sensed directly by cell cycle regulators to prevent cell cycle progression in absence of sufficient metabolic fluxes. In turn, cell cycle regulators such as the cyclin-dependent kinase directly control metabolic fluxes during cell cycle progression.

However, little is known about how metabolic fluxes are coordinated with the cell division cycle. Here, we examine budding yeast to show that more than half of all measured metabolites change significantly through the cell division cycle. Cell cycle-dependent changes in central carbon metabolism are controlled by the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk1), a major cell cycle regulator, and the metabolic regulator protein kinase A. At the G1/S transition, Cdk1 phosphorylates and activates the enzyme Nth1, which funnels the storage carbohydrate trehalose into central carbon metabolism. Trehalose utilization fuels anabolic processes required to reliably complete cell division. Thus, the cell cycle entrains carbon metabolism to fuel biosynthesis. Because the oscillation of Cdk activity is a conserved feature of the eukaryotic cell cycle, we anticipate its frequent use in dynamically regulating metabolism for efficient proliferation.},

Commitment of a certain mass fraction of the proteome to a specific cellular function typically reduces the proteome available for other cellular functions. Here, we develop a semi-quantitative kinetic model of cyanobacterial phototrophic growth to describe such trade-offs of cellular protein allocation. The model is based on coarse-grained descriptions of key cellular processes, in particular carbon uptake, metabolism, photosynthesis, and protein translation. The model is parameterized using literature data and experimentally obtained growth curves. Of particular interest are the resulting cyanobacterial growth laws as fundamental characteristics of cellular growth. We show that the model gives rise to similar growth laws as observed for heterotrophic organisms, with several important differences due to the distinction between light energy and carbon uptake. We discuss recent experimental data supporting the model results and show that coarse-grained growth models have implications for our understanding of the limits of phototrophic growth and bridge a gap between molecular physiology and ecology.},

A constraint-based in silico analysis procedure was used to compute properties of the S. cerevisiae metabolic network. The computed number of ATP molecules produced per pair of electrons donated to the electron transport system (ETS) and energy-maintenance requirements were quantitatively in agreement with experimental results. Computed whole-cell functions of growth and metabolic by-product secretion in aerobic and anaerobic culture were consistent with experimental data, and thus mRNA expression profiles during metabolic shifts were computed. The computed consequences of gene knockouts on growth phenotypes were consistent with experimental observations. Thus, constraint-based analysis of a genome-scale metabolic network for the eukaryotic S. cerevisiae allows for computation of its integrated functions, producing in silico results that were consistent with observed phenotypic functions for {$\approx$}70\textendash 80\% of the conditions considered.},

Moreover, we demonstrate that the decline in {$\Delta\Psi$}, which is observed only in a fraction of cells, is not responsible for entry into senescence. Rather, the loss of {$\Delta\Psi$} is an age-independent and heritable process that leads to clonal senescence and is therefore incompatible with daughter cell rejuvenation.

  abstract = {Transcription is necessary for the synthesis of new proteins, often leading to the assumption that changes in transcript levels lead to changes in protein levels which directly impact a cell's phenotype. Using a synchronized biological rhythm, we show that despite genome-wide partitioning of transcription, transcripts and translation levels into two phase-shifted expression clusters related to metabolism, detectable protein levels remain constant over time. This disconnect between cycling translation and constant protein levels can be explained by slow protein turnover rates, with overall protein levels maintained by low level pulses of new protein synthesis. Instead, rhythmic post-translational regulation of the activities of different proteins, influenced by the metabolic state of the cells, appears to be key to coordinating the physiology of the biological rhythm with cycling transcription. Thus, transcriptional and translational cycling reflects, rather than drives, metabolic and biosynthetic changes during biological rhythms. We propose that transcriptional changes are often the consequence, rather than the cause, of changes in cellular physiology and that caution is needed when inferring the activity of biological processes from transcript data. Changes in protein levels do not explain the changing states of a biological rhythmSlow protein turnover rates decouple proteins levels from a rhythmic transcriptomeMetabolites determine protein activity via rhythmic post-translational modificationsCycling protein activity explains rhythmic transcription and ribosome biogenesisA cycling transcriptome is a consequence, not a cause, of physiological changes {$<$}img class="highwire-fragment fragment-image" alt="Figure" src="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/06/10/833921/F1.medium.gif" width="440" height="437"/{$>$}Download figureOpen in new tab},

  abstract = {In the continuous mode of cell culture, a constant flow carrying fresh media replaces culture fluid, cells, nutrients and secreted metabolites. Here we present a model for continuous cell culture coupling intra-cellular metabolism to extracellular variables describing the state of the bioreactor, taking into account the growth capacity of the cell and the impact of toxic byproduct accumulation. We provide a method to determine the steady states of this system that is tractable for metabolic networks of arbitrary complexity. We demonstrate our approach in a toy model first, and then in a genome-scale metabolic network of the Chinese hamster ovary cell line, obtaining results that are in qualitative agreement with experimental observations. We derive a number of consequences from the model that are independent of parameter values. The ratio between cell density and dilution rate is an ideal control parameter to fix a steady state with desired metabolic properties. This conclusion is robust even in the presence of multi-stability, which is explained in our model by a negative feedback loop due to toxic byproduct accumulation. A complex landscape of steady states emerges from our simulations, including multiple metabolic switches, which also explain why cell-line and media benchmarks carried out in batch culture cannot be extrapolated to perfusion. On the other hand, we predict invariance laws between continuous cell cultures with different parameters. A practical consequence is that the chemostat is an ideal experimental model for large-scale high-density perfusion cultures, where the complex landscape of metabolic transitions is faithfully reproduced.},

Exploring intercellular coupling among cell-autonomous circadian oscillators is crucial for understanding how cellular ensembles generate and sustain coherent circadian rhythms on the tissue level, and thus, rhythmic organ functions. Here we describe a protocol for studying intercellular coupling among peripheral circadian oscillators using three-dimensional spheroid cultures in order to measure coupling strength within peripheral clock networks. We use cell spheroids to simulate in vivo tissue integrity, as well as to increase complexity of cell\textendash cell interactions and the abundance of potential coupling factors. Circadian rhythms are monitored using live-cell imaging of spheroids equipped with circadian reporters over several days.},

This BVP model serves as a simple representative of a class of excitable-oscillatory systems including the Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model of the squid giant axon. The BVP phase plane can be divided into regions corresponding to the physiological states of nerve fiber (resting, active, refractory, enhanced, depressed, etc.) to form a ``physiological state diagram,'' with the help of which many physiological phenomena can be summarized. A properly chosen projection from the 4-dimensional HH phase space onto a plane produces a similar diagram which shows the underlying relationship between the two models. Impulse trains occur in the BVP and HH models for a range of constant applied currents which make the singular point representing the resting state unstable.},

A popular method now widely used relies on the optimization of a quantity called modularity, which is a quality index for a partition of a network into communities. We find that modularity optimization may fail to identify modules smaller than a scale which depends on the total size of the network and on the degree of interconnectedness of the modules, even in cases where modules are unambiguously defined. This finding is confirmed through several examples, both in artificial and in real social, biological, and technological networks, where we show that modularity optimization indeed does not resolve a large number of modules. A check of the modules obtained through modularity optimization is thus necessary, and we provide here key elements for the assessment of the reliability of this community detection method.},

Here, we demonstrate that transiently expressed genes in mammalian cells compete for limited transcriptional and translational resources. This competition results in the coupling of otherwise independent exogenous and endogenous genes, creating a divergence between intended and actual function. Guided by a resource-aware mathematical model, we identify and engineer natural and synthetic miRNA-based incoherent feedforward loop (iFFL) circuits that mitigate gene expression burden. The implementation of these circuits features the use of endogenous miRNAs as elementary components of the engineered iFFL device, a versatile hybrid design that allows burden mitigation to be achieved across different cell-lines with minimal resource requirements. This study establishes the foundations for context-aware prediction and improvement of in vivo synthetic circuit performance, paving the way towards more rational synthetic construct design in mammalian cells.},

We show that the circadian Per2 expression is better sustained via a 24\,h period and 12\,h:12\,h frequency-encoded metabolic stimulation applied for 3 daily cycles, aligned to the cell-autonomous clock, entraining the expression of hundreds of genes mostly belonging to circadian rhythms and cell cycle pathways. On the contrary misaligned feeding-fasting cycles synchronize and amplify the expression of extracellular matrix-associated genes, aligned during the light phase.

However, the complex metabolic regulation makes it challenging in driving the metabolic flux toward the product biosynthesis. Dynamically coupling the biosynthetic pathways with the cellular metabolism at spatial\textendash temporal manner should be helpful for improving the production with alleviating the cellular stresses.                                         Results                                In this study, we observed the mismatch between fatty alcohol biosynthesis and cellular metabolism, which compromised the fatty alcohol production in                 Saccharomyces cerevisiae                 . To enhance the fatty alcohol production, we spatial-temporally regulated fatty alcohol biosynthetic pathway by peroxisomal compartmentalization (spatial) and dynamic regulation of gene expression (temporal). In particular, fatty acid/acyl-CoA responsive promoters were identified by comparative transcriptional analysis, which helped to dynamically regulate the expression of acyl-CoA reductase gene                 MaFAR1                 and improved fatty alcohol biosynthesis by 1.62-fold. Furthermore, enhancing the peroxisomal supply of acyl-CoA and NADPH further improved fatty alcohol production to 282~mg/L, 2.52 times higher than the starting strain.

Trade-offs arise, however. Mechanisms that aberrantly increase cell size or proliferation\textemdash such as mutations or chemicals that interfere with growth regulatory pathways\textemdash can also shorten lifespan. Here we report a natural example of how the interplay between growth and lifespan can be epigenetically controlled. We find that a highly conserved RNA-modifying enzyme, the pseudouridine synthase Pus4/TruB, can act as a prion, endowing yeast with greater proliferation rates at the cost of a shortened lifespan. Cells harboring the prion grow larger and exhibit altered protein synthesis. This epigenetic state, [BIG+] (better in growth), allows cells to heritably yet reversibly alter their translational program, leading to the differential synthesis of dozens of proteins, including many that regulate proliferation and aging. Our data reveal a new role for prion-based control of an RNA-modifying enzyme in driving heritable epigenetic states that transform cell growth and survival.},

In budding yeast, although some molecular mechanisms responsible for cell size control during G1 have been elucidated, the mechanism by which cell size homeostasis is established remains to be discovered. Here, we developed a new technique based on quantification of histone levels to monitor cell cycle progression in individual cells with unprecedented accuracy. Our analysis establishes the existence of a mechanism controlling bud size in G2/M that prevents premature onset of anaphase, and controls the overall size variability. While most G1 mutants do not display impaired size homeostasis, mutants in which cyclin B-Cdk regulation is altered display large size variability. Our study thus demonstrates that size homeostasis is not controlled by a G1-specific mechanism alone but is likely to be an emergent property resulting from the integration of several mechanisms that coordinate cell and bud growth with division.},

To investigate this, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to quantify transcript heterogeneity in single Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells treated with and without salt stress to explore population variation and identify cellular covariates that influence the stress-responsive transcriptome. Leveraging the extensive knowledge of yeast transcriptional regulation, we uncovered significant regulatory variation in individual yeast cells, both before and after stress. We also discovered that a subset of cells appears to decouple expression of ribosomal protein genes from the environmental stress response in a manner partly correlated with the cell cycle but unrelated to the yeast ultradian metabolic cycle. Live-cell imaging of cells expressing pairs of fluorescent regulators, including the transcription factor Msn2 with Dot6, Sfp1, or MAP kinase Hog1, revealed both coordinated and decoupled nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Together with transcriptomic analysis, our results suggest that cells maintain a cellular filter against decoupled bursts of transcription factor activation but mount a stress response upon coordinated regulation, even in a subset of unstressed cells.},

We show that while one-directional coupling maintains stable oscillation of individual repressilators, there are well-characterized parameter regimes of mutually coupled repressilators, where oscillations stop. In other parameter regimes, joint oscillations continue. Our results may have implications for the understanding of condition-dependent coupling and un-coupling of regulatory networks.},

In particular we present the benefits of the approach for secondary phase analysis steps illustrated by reconstruction of the phase response curve.

  abstract = {The cell division cycle and the circadian clock represent two major cellular rhythms. These two periodic processes are coupled in multiple ways, given that several molecular components of the cell cycle network are controlled in a circadian manner. For example, in the network of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) that governs progression along the successive phases of the cell cycle, the synthesis of the kinase Wee1, which inhibits the G2/M transition, is enhanced by the complex CLOCK-BMAL1 that plays a central role in the circadian clock network. Another component of the latter network, REV-ERB{$\alpha$}, inhibits the synthesis of the Cdk inhibitor p21. Moreover, the synthesis of the oncogene c-Myc, which promotes G1 cyclin synthesis, is repressed by CLOCK-BMAL1. Using detailed computational models for the two networks we investigate the conditions in which the mammalian cell cycle can be entrained by the circadian clock. We show that the cell cycle can be brought to oscillate at a period of 24 h or 48 h when its autonomous period prior to coupling is in an appropriate range. The model indicates that the combination of multiple modes of coupling does not necessarily facilitate entrainment of the cell cycle by the circadian clock. Entrainment can also occur as a result of circadian variations in the level of a growth factor controlling entry into G1. Outside the range of entrainment, the coupling to the circadian clock may lead to disconnected oscillations in the cell cycle and the circadian system, or to complex oscillatory dynamics of the cell cycle in the form of endoreplication, complex periodic oscillations or chaos. The model predicts that the transition from entrainment to 24 h or 48 h might occur when the strength of coupling to the circadian clock or the level of growth factor decrease below critical values.},

Through immunodetection of the common tag, we obtain a census of proteins expressed during log-phase growth and measurements of their absolute levels. We find that about 80\% of the proteome is expressed during normal growth conditions, and, using additional sequence information, we systematically identify misannotated genes. The abundance of proteins ranges from fewer than 50 to more than 106 molecules per cell. Many of these molecules, including essential proteins and most transcription factors, are present at levels that are not readily detectable by other proteomic techniques nor predictable by mRNA levels or codon bias measurements.},

Each perspective adds its contribution to the understanding of the system, thus the three approaches do not compete, but complement each other. We illustrate our approach by applying it to an extended model of the three stage cascade, which forms the core of the ERK signal transduction pathway. Consequently our focus is on transient behaviour analysis. We demonstrate how qualitative descriptions are abstractions over stochastic or continuous descriptions, and show that the stochastic and continuous models approximate each other. A key contribution of the paper consists in a precise definition of biochemically interpreted stochastic Petri nets. Although our framework is based on Petri nets, it can be applied more widely to other formalisms which are used to model and analyse biochemical networks.},

Researchers are increasingly using this approach to chemical kinetics in the analysis of cellular systems in biology, where the small molecular populations of only a few reactant species can lead to deviations from the predictions of the deterministic differential equations of classical chemical kinetics. After reviewing the supporting theory of stochastic chemical kinetics, I discuss some recent advances in methods for using that theory to make numerical simulations. These include improvements to the exact stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) and the approximate explicit tau-leaping procedure, as well as the development of two approximate strategies for simulating systems that are dynamically stiff: implicit tau-leaping and the slow-scale SSA.},

Topics discussed include: How are rhythms generated? How do they start and stop? What are the effects of perturbation of the rhythms? How are oscillations organized in space? Leon Glass and Michael Mackey address an audience of biological scientists, physicians, physical scientists, and mathematicians, but the work assumes no knowledge of advanced mathematics. Variation of rhythms outside normal limits, or appearance of new rhythms where none existed previously, are associated with disease. One of the most interesting features of the book is that it makes a start at explaining "dynamical diseases" that are not the result of infection by pathogens but that stem from abnormalities in the timing of essential functions. From Clocks to Chaos provides a firm foundation for understanding dynamic processes in physiology.},

We then obtain a new method, called Resource Balance Analysis (RBA), predicting the distribution of the available resources in the medium among the various cellular subsystems. Beyond its predictive capability, the proposed approach grasps some fundamental aspects of the bacterium physiology by including a refined model. This method reveals the existence of an intrinsic bottleneck in the system resource distribution of the bacterium, leading to the existence of a structural limitation of its growth rate which can be predicted. RBA is also able to predict the configuration of the metabolic network for a given medium at steady-state regimen which nicely fits the available experimental results for the gram-positive model bacterium Bacillus subtilis.},

  abstract = {A minimal model for the mitotic oscillator is presented. The model, built on recent experimental advances, is based on the cascade of post-translational modification that modulates the activity of cdc2 kinase during the cell cycle. The model pertains to the situation encountered in early amphibian embryos, where the accumulation of cyclin suffices to trigger the onset of mitosis. In the first cycle of the bicyclic cascade model, cyclin promotes the activation of cdc2 kinase through reversible dephosphorylation, and in the second cycle, cdc2 kinase activates a cyclin protease by reversible phosphorylation. That cyclin activates cdc2 kinase while the kinase triggers the degradation of cyclin has suggested that oscillations may originate from such a negative feedback loop [F\'elix, M. A., Labb\'e, J. C., Dor\'ee, M., Hunt, T. \& Karsenti, E. (1990) Nature (London) 346, 379-382]. This conjecture is corroborated by the model, which indicates that sustained oscillations of the limit cycle type can arise in the cascade, provided that a threshold exists in the activation of cdc2 kinase by cyclin and in the activation of cyclin proteolysis by cdc2 kinase. The analysis shows how miototic oscillations may readily arise from time lags associated with these thresholds and from the delayed negative feedback provided by cdc2-induced cyclin degradation. A mechanism for the origin of the thresholds is proposed in terms of the phenomenon of zero-order ultrasensitivity previously described for biochemical systems regulated by covalent modification.},

  abstract = {While experimental and theoretical studies have established the prevalence of rhythmic behaviour at all levels of biological organization, less common is the coexistence between multiple oscillatory regimes (multi-rhythmicity), which has been predicted by a variety of models for biological oscillators. The phenomenon of multi-rhythmicity involves, most commonly, the coexistence between two (birhythmicity) or three (trirhythmicity) distinct regimes of self-sustained oscillations. Birhythmicity has been observed experimentally in a few chemical reactions and in biological examples pertaining to cardiac cell physiology, neurobiology, human voice patterns and ecology. The present study consists of two parts. We first review the mechanisms underlying multi-rhythmicity in models for biochemical and cellular oscillations in which the phenomenon was investigated over the years. In the second part, we focus on the coupling of the cell cycle and the circadian clock and show how an additional source of multi-rhythmicity arises from the bidirectional coupling of these two cellular oscillators. Upon bidirectional coupling, the two oscillatory networks generally synchronize in a unique manner characterized by a single, common period. In some conditions, however, the two oscillators may synchronize in two or three different ways characterized by distinct waveforms and periods. We refer to this type of multi-rhythmicity as `multi-synchronization'.},

Engineered systems made of synthetic micron-sized compartments and integrated reaction networks coupled with mathematical modeling can facilitate the design and construction of complex and multiscale chemical systems from the bottom-up. Toward this goal, we generated populations of monodisperse liposomes encapsulating cell-free expression systems (CFESs) using double-emulsion microfluidics and quantified transcription and translation dynamics within individual synthetic cells of the population using a fluorescent Broccoli RNA aptamer and mCherry protein reporter. CFE dynamics in bulk reactions were used to test different coarse-grained resource-limited gene expression models using model selection to obtain transcription and translation rate parameters by likelihood-based parameter estimation. The selected model was then applied to quantify cell-free gene expression dynamics in populations of synthetic cells. In combination, our experimental and theoretical approaches provide a statistically robust analysis of CFE dynamics in bulk and monodisperse synthetic cell populations. We demonstrate that compartmentalization of CFESs leads to different transcription and translation rates compared to bulk CFE and show that this is due to the semipermeable lipid membrane that allows the exchange of materials between the synthetic cells and the external environment.},

Here, we present a broad characterization of its performance in such situations. First, we revisit and clarify the resolution limit phenomenon for modularity maximization. Second, we show that the modularity function Q exhibits extreme degeneracies: it typically admits an exponential number of distinct high-scoring solutions and typically lacks a clear global maximum. Third, we derive the limiting behavior of the maximum modularity Qmax for one model of infinitely modular networks, showing that it depends strongly both on the size of the network and on the number of modules it contains. Finally, using three real-world metabolic networks as examples, we show that the degenerate solutions can fundamentally disagree on many, but not all, partition properties such as the composition of the largest modules and the distribution of module sizes. These results imply that the output of any modularity maximization procedure should be interpreted cautiously in scientific contexts. They also explain why many heuristics are often successful at finding high-scoring partitions in practice and why different heuristics can disagree on the modular structure of the same network. We conclude by discussing avenues for mitigating some of these behaviors, such as combining information from many degenerate solutions or using generative models.},

Since such control mechanisms are known to have an intrinsic tendency to oscillate, and since rhythmic processes constitute a prominent dynamic feature of plant and animal physiology, it is suggested that spontaneous oscillatory behavior in an organism's control processes constitutes the dynamic basis of rhythmic behavior patterns. A computer (analogue) analysis is presented of differential equations representing control of enzyme synthesis by feedback repression, and non-linear oscillations are shown to occur. Phenomena such as synchronous locking and subharmonic resonance are shown to arise from the interaction of these oscillators, and the physiological significance of such non-linear behavior is discussed.

  abstract = {Mammalian cells exhibit a high degree of intercellular variability in cell cycle period and phase durations. However, the factors orchestrating the cell cycle duration heterogeneities remain unclear. Herein, by combining cell cycle network-based mathematical models with live single-cell imaging studies under varied serum conditions, we demonstrate that fluctuating transcription rates of cell cycle regulatory genes across cell lineages and during cell cycle progression in mammalian cells majorly govern the robust correlation patterns of cell cycle period and phase durations among sister, cousin, and mother-daughter lineage pairs. However, for the overall cellular population, alteration in serum level modulates the fluctuation and correlation patterns of cell cycle period and phase durations in a correlated manner. These heterogeneities at the population level can be finetuned under limited serum conditions by perturbing the cell cycle network using a p38-signaling inhibitor without affecting the robust lineage level correlations. Overall, our approach identifies transcriptional fluctuations as the key controlling factor for the cell cycle duration heterogeneities, and predicts ways to reduce cell-to-cell variabilities by perturbing the cell cycle network regulations. Significance statement In malignant tumors, cells display a diverse pattern in cell division time. This cell-to-cell variability in cell cycle duration had been observed even under culture conditions for various mammalian cells. Here we used live-cell imaging studies to monitor FUCCI-HeLa cells and quantified the cell cycle period and time spent in different phases under varied serum conditions. We proposed a set of stochastic cell cycle network-based mathematical models to investigate the live-cell imaging data and unraveled that the transcription rate variation across cell lineages and during cell cycle phases explains every aspect of the cell cycle duration variabilities. Our models identified how different deterministic effects and stochastic fluctuations control these variabilities and predicted ways to alter these cell cycle duration variabilities.},

For example, in nutrient-limited environments, 50\% of all S.~cerevisiae genes synchronize and exhibit periodic bursts of expression in coordination with respiration and cell division in the yeast metabolic cycle (YMC). Despite the importance of metabolic and proliferative synchrony, the majority of YMC regulators are currently unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the INO80 chromatin-remodeling complex is required to coordinate respiration and cell division with periodic gene expression. Specifically, INO80 mutants have severe defects in oxygen consumption and promiscuous cell division that is no~longer coupled with metabolic status. In mutant cells, chromatin accessibility of periodic genes, including TORC1-responsive genes, is relatively static, concomitant with severely attenuated gene expression. Collectively, these results reveal that the INO80 complex mediates metabolic signaling to chromatin to restrict proliferation to metabolically optimal states.},

  abstract = {Metabolic signaling to chromatin often underlies how adaptive transcriptional responses are controlled. While intermediary metabolites serve as co-factors for histone-modifying enzymes during metabolic flux, how these modifications contribute to transcriptional responses is poorly understood. Here, we utilize the highly synchronized yeast metabolic cycle (YMC) and find that fatty acid {$\beta$}-oxidation genes are periodically expressed coincident with the {$\beta$}-oxidation byproduct histone crotonylation. Specifically, we found that H3K9 crotonylation peaks when H3K9 acetylation declines and energy resources become limited. During this metabolic state, pro-growth gene expression is dampened; however, mutation of the Taf14 YEATS domain, a H3K9 crotonylation reader, results in de-repression of these genes. Conversely, exogenous addition of crotonic acid results in increased histone crotonylation, constitutive repression of pro-growth genes, and disrupted YMC oscillations. Together, our findings expose an unexpected link between metabolic flux and transcription and demonstrate that histone crotonylation and Taf14 participate in the repression of energy-demanding gene expression.},

Here, we study this organization of information in budding yeast by estimating the mutual information between environmental transitions and the dynamics of nuclear translocation for 10 transcription factors. Our method of estimation is general, scalable, and based on decoding from single cells. The dynamics of the transcription factors are necessary to encode the highest amounts of extracellular information, and we show that information is transduced through two channels: Generalists (Msn2/4, Tod6 and Dot6, Maf1, and Sfp1) can encode the nature of multiple stresses, but only if stress is high; specialists (Hog1, Yap1, and Mig1/2) encode one particular stress, but do so more quickly and for a wider range of magnitudes. In particular, Dot6 encodes almost as much information as Msn2, the master regulator of the environmental stress response. Each transcription factor reports differently, and it is only their collective behavior that distinguishes between multiple environmental states. Changes in the dynamics of the localization of transcription factors thus constitute a precise, distributed internal representation of extracellular change. We predict that such multidimensional representations are common in cellular decision-making.},

Cells with only the less accurate, reflex-like pathway are fitter in sudden stress, whereas cells with only the slow, more accurate pathway are fitter in increasing but fluctuating stress. Our results demonstrate that cellular signalling is vulnerable to trade-offs in performance, but that these trade-offs can be mitigated by assigning the opposing tasks to different signalling subnetworks. Such division of labour could function broadly within cellular signal transduction.},

In this paper, we propose new schemes for both mutation and crossover operators in order to enhance the performances of the standard DEA. The advantage of these proposed operators is that they are ``parameters-less'', without a tuning phase of algorithm parameters that is often a disadvantage of DEA. Once the modified differential evolutions are presented, a large comparative analysis is performed with the aim to assess both correctness and efficiency of the proposed operators. Advantages of proposed DEA are used in an important task of modern structural engineering that is mechanical identification under external dynamic loads. This is because of the importance of using a ``parameters-less'' algorithm in identification problems whose characteristics typically vary strongly case by case, needing of a continuous set up of the algorithm proposed. This important advantage of proposed optimizers, in front of other identification algorithms, is used to develop a computer code suitable for the automatic identification of a simple supported beam subject to an impact load, that has been tested both using numerical simulations and real standard tests dynamic. The results point out that this algorithm is an interesting candidate for standard applications in structural identification problems.},

The eukaryotic cell cycle follows a basic template with an ordered series of events beginning with G1 (Gap1) phase, followed successively by S (Synthesis) phase, G2 (Gap 2) phase, and M-phase (Mitosis). The process is tightly regulated in response to signals from both the internal and external milieu. The budding yeast S. cerevisiae is an outstanding model for the study of the cell cycle and its regulatory process. The basic events and regulatory processes of the S. cerevisiae cell cycle are highly conserved with other eukaryotes. The organism grows rapidly in simple medium, has a sequenced annotated genome, well-established genetics, and is amenable to analysis by proteomics and microscopy. Additionally, a range of tools and techniques are available to generate cultures of S. cerevisiae that are homogenously arrested or captured at specific phases of the cell cycle and upon release from that arrest these can be used to monitor cell cycle events as the cells synchronously proceed through a division cycle. In this chapter, we describe a series of commonly used techniques that are used to generate synchronized populations of S. cerevisiae and provide an overview of methods that can be used to monitor the progression of the cells through the cell division cycle.},

Microbes therefore invest a considerable amount of their resources into proteins needed for energy harvesting. Growth in different environments is associated with different energy demands for growth of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, although the cross-condition differences remain poorly characterized. Furthermore, a direct comparison of the energy costs for the biosynthesis of the new biomass across conditions is not feasible experimentally; computational models, on the contrary, allow comparing the optimal metabolic strategies and quantify the respective costs of energy and nutrients. Thus in this study, we used a resource allocation model of S. cerevisiae to compare the optimal metabolic strategies between different conditions. We found that S. cerevisiae with respiratory-impaired mitochondria required additional energetic investments for growth, while growth on amino acid-rich media was not affected. Amino acid supplementation in anaerobic conditions also was predicted to rescue the growth reduction in mitochondrial respiratory shuttle-deficient mutants of S. cerevisiae. Collectively, these results point to elevated costs of resolving the redox imbalance caused by de novo biosynthesis of amino acids in mitochondria. To sum up, our study provides an example of how resource allocation modeling can be used to address and suggest explanations to open questions in microbial physiology.},

An open question is if this apparent expression level is really an overcapacity, or maintains the (optimal) enzyme capacity needed to carry flux at (very) low substrate availability. Here, we use computational modeling to suggest that yeast maintains a genuine excess of glycolytic enzymes at low specific growth rates. During fast fermentative growth at high glucose levels, the observed expression of the glycolytic enzymes matched the predicted optimal levels. We suggest that excess glycolytic capacity at low glucose levels is a preparatory strategy in the adaptation to sugar fluctuations in the environment.},

In addition, we found that flavoenzymes play a central role in various aspects of iron metabolism, such as iron uptake, the biogenesis of iron\textendash sulfur clusters and insertion of the heme cofactor into apocytochromes. Another important group of flavoenzymes is directly (Dus1-4p and Mto1p) or indirectly (Tyw1p) involved in reactions leading to tRNA-modifications. Despite the wealth of genetic information available for S. cerevisiae, we were surprised that many flavoproteins are poorly characterized biochemically. For example, the role of the yeast flavodoxins Pst2p, Rfs1p and Ycp4p with regard to their electron donor and acceptor is presently unknown. Similarly, the function of the heterodimeric Aim45p/Cir1p, which is homologous to the electron-transferring flavoproteins of higher eukaryotes, in electron transfer processes occurring in the mitochondrial matrix remains to be elucidated. This lack of information extends to the five membrane proteins involved in riboflavin or FAD transport as well as FMN and FAD homeostasis within the yeast cell.

In this work, we present the first systematic study of in vivo maturation for 12 FPs in budding yeast. To overcome the technical limitations of translation inhibitors commonly used to study FP maturation, we implemented a new approach based on the optogenetic stimulations of FP expression in cells grown under constant nutrient conditions. Combining the rapid and orthogonal induction of FP transcription with a mathematical model of expression and maturation allowed us to accurately estimate maturation rates from microscopy data in a minimally invasive manner. Besides providing a useful resource for the budding yeast community, we present a new joint experimental and computational approach for characterizing FP maturation, which is applicable to a wide range of organisms.},

However, measurements of TORC1 and PKA activity during the cell cycle are still lacking. Following the localization dynamics of two TORC1 and PKA targets via time-lapse microscopy in hundreds of yeast cells, we found that the activity of these pathways towards ribosome biogenesis fluctuates in synchrony with the cell cycle even under constant external conditions. Mutations of upstream TORC1 and PKA regulators suggested that internal metabolic signals partially mediate these activity changes.

Our understanding of long-term transcriptional responses to phosphate limitation is extensive. Contrastingly, a systems-level perspective presenting unifying biochemical concepts to interpret how phosphate balance is critically coupled to (and controls) metabolic information flow is missing. To conceptualize such processes, utilizing yeast metabolic networks we categorize phosphates utilized in metabolism into cycles, sources and sinks. Through this, we identify metabolic reactions leading to putative phosphate sources or sinks. With this conceptualization, we illustrate how mass action driven flux towards sources and sinks enable cells to manage phosphate availability during transient/immediate phosphate limitations. We thereby identify how intracellular phosphate availability will predictably alter specific nodes in carbon metabolism, and determine signature cellular metabolic states.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}It is increasingly appreciated that intracellular pH changes are important biological signals. This motivates the elucidation of molecular mechanisms of pH-sensing. We determined that a nucleocytoplasmic pH oscillation was required for the transcriptional response to carbon starvation in \emph{S. cerevisiae}. The SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex is a key mediator of this transcriptional response. We found that a glutamine-rich low complexity sequence (QLC) in the \emph{SNF5} subunit of this complex, and histidines within this sequence, were required for efficient transcriptional reprogramming during carbon starvation. Furthermore, the \emph{SNF5} QLC mediated pH-dependent recruitment of SWI/SNF to a model promoter \emph{in vitro}. Simulations showed that protonation of histidines within the \emph{SNF5} QLC lead to conformational expansion, providing a potential biophysical mechanism for regulation of these interactions. Together, our results indicate that that pH changes are a second messenger for transcriptional reprogramming during carbon starvation, and that the \emph{SNF5} QLC acts as a pH-sensor.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Protein synthesis is energetically expensive and its rate is influenced by factors such as cell type and environment. Suppression of translation is a canonical response to stressful changes in the cellular environment. In particular, inhibition of the initiation step of translation has been highlighted as the key control step in stress-induced translational suppression as mechanisms that quickly suppress initiation are well-conserved. However, cells have evolved complex regulatory means to control translation apart from initiation. Here, we examine the role of the elongation step of translation in yeast subjected to acute glucose deprivation. The use of ribosome profiling and in vivo reporter assays demonstrated elongation rates slow progressively following glucose removal. We observed that ribosome distribution broadly shifts towards the downstream ends of transcripts after both acute and gradual glucose deprivation but not in response to other stressors. Additionally, on assessed mRNAs, a correlation existed between ribosome occupancy and protein production pre-stress but was lost after stress. These results indicate that stress-induced elongation regulation causes ribosomes to slow down and build up on a considerable proportion of the transcriptome in response to glucose withdrawal. Finally, we report ribosomes that built up along transcripts are competent to resume elongation and complete protein synthesis after readdition of glucose to starved cells. This suggests that yeast has evolved mechanisms to slow translation elongation in response to glucose starvation which do not preclude continuation of protein production from those ribosomes, thereby averting a need for new initiation events to take place to synthesize proteins.Abbreviations: AUG: start codon, bp: base pair(s), CDS: coding sequence, CHX: cycloheximide, eEF2: eukaryotic elongation factor 2, LTM: lactimidomycin, nt: nucleotide, PGK1: 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, ribosomal biogenesis: ribi, RO: ribosome occupancy, RPF: ribosome protected fragment, TE: translational efficiency},

  abstract = {Mating type in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is determined by two nonhomologous alleles, MATa and MAT{$\alpha$}. These sequences encode regulators of the two different haploid mating types and of the diploids formed by their conjugation. Analysis of the MATa1, MAT{$\alpha$}1, and MAT{$\alpha$}2 alleles provided one of the earliest models of cell-type specification by transcriptional activators and repressors. Remarkably, homothallic yeast cells can switch their mating type as often as every generation by a highly choreographed, site-specific homologous recombination event that replaces one MAT allele with different DNA sequences encoding the opposite MAT allele. This replacement process involves the participation of two intact but unexpressed copies of mating-type information at the heterochromatic loci, HML{$\alpha$} and HMRa, which are located at opposite ends of the same chromosome-encoding MAT. The study of MAT switching has yielded important insights into the control of cell lineage, the silencing of gene expression, the formation of heterochromatin, and the regulation of accessibility of the donor sequences. Real-time analysis of MAT switching has provided the most detailed description of the molecular events that occur during the homologous recombinational repair of a programmed double-strand chromosome break.},

Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) are key cell cycle regulators, and Cdc55 is a regulatory subunit of PP2A in budding yeast. We found that yeast cells lacking functional PP2ACdc55 showed slow growth in the presence of hydroxyurea (HU), a DNA synthesis inhibitor, without obvious viability loss. Moreover, PP2A mutants exhibited delayed anaphase entry and sustained levels of anaphase inhibitor Pds1 after HU treatment. A DNA damage checkpoint Chk1 phosphorylates and stabilizes Pds1. We show that chk1{$\Delta$} and mutation of the Chk1 phosphorylation sites in Pds1 largely restored efficient anaphase entry in PP2A mutants after HU treatment. In addition, deletion of SWE1, which encodes the inhibitory kinase for CDK or mutation of the Swe1 phosphorylation site in CDK (cdc28F19), also suppressed the anaphase entry delay in PP2A mutants after HU treatment. Our genetic data suggest that Swe1/CDK acts upstream of Pds1. Surprisingly, cdc55{$\Delta$} showed significant suppression to the viability loss of S-phase checkpoint mutants during DNA synthesis block. Together, our results uncover a PP2A-Swe1-CDK-Chk1-Pds1 axis that promotes recovery from DNA replication stress.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Stochastic models are key to understanding the intricate dynamics of gene expression. But the simplest models which only account for e.g. active and inactive states of a gene fail to capture common observations in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Here we consider multistate models of gene expression which generalise the canonical Telegraph process, and are capable of capturing the joint effects of e.g. transcription factors, heterochromatin state and DNA accessibility (or, in prokaryotes, Sigma-factor activity) on transcript abundance. We propose two approaches for solving classes of these generalised systems. The first approach offers a fresh perspective on a general class of multistate models, and allows us to "decompose" more complicated systems into simpler processes, each of which can be solved analytically. This enables us to obtain a solution of any model from this class. We further show that these models cannot have a heavy-tailed distribution in the absence of extrinsic noise. Next, we develop an approximation method based on a power series expansion of the stationary distribution for an even broader class of multistate models of gene transcription. The combination of analytical and computational solutions for these realistic gene expression models also holds the potential to design synthetic systems, and control the behaviour of naturally evolved gene expression systems, e.g. in guiding cell-fate decisions.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The cell-autonomous and circuit-level mechanisms whereby VIP synchronises the SCN are poorly understood. We show that SCN slices in organotypic culture demonstrate rapid and sustained circuit-level circadian responses to VIP that are mediated at a cell-autonomous level. This is accompanied by changes across a broad transcriptional network and by significant VIP-directed plasticity in the internal phasing of the cell-autonomous TTFL. Signalling via ERK1/2 and tuning by its negative regulator DUSP4 are critical elements of the VIP-directed circadian re-programming. In summary, we provide detailed mechanistic insight into VIP signal transduction in the SCN at the level of genes, cells and neural circuit.},

Although many natural systems display perfect adaptation, whereby stationary molecular concentrations are insensitive to perturbations, its de novo engineering has proven elusive. The discovery of the antithetic control motif was a significant step towards a universal mechanism for engineering perfect adaptation. Antithetic control provides perfect adaptation in a wide range of systems, but it can lead to oscillatory dynamics due to loss of stability; moreover, it can lose perfect adaptation in fast growing cultures. Here, we introduce an extended antithetic control motif that resolves these limitations. We show that molecular buffering, a widely conserved mechanism for homeostatic control in Nature, stabilizes oscillations and allows for near-perfect adaptation during rapid growth. We study multiple buffering topologies and compare their performance in terms of their stability and adaptation properties. We illustrate the benefits of our proposed strategy in exemplar models for biofuel production and growth rate control in bacterial cultures. Our results provide an improved circuit for robust control of biomolecular systems.},

Such adaptations control specific metabolic pathways to match energetic demands with nutrient availability. Upon depletion of nutrients, rapid pathway recovery is key to release cellular resources required for survival in the new nutritional condition. Yet little is known about the regulatory strategies that microbes employ to accelerate pathway recovery in response to nutrient depletion. Using the fatty acid catabolic pathway in Escherichia coli, here we show that fast recovery can be achieved by rapid release of a transcriptional regulator from a metabolite-sequestered complex. With a combination of mathematical modelling and experiments, we show that recovery dynamics depend critically on the rate of metabolite consumption and the exposure time to nutrient. We constructed strains with re-wired transcriptional regulatory architectures that highlight the metabolic benefits of negative autoregulation over constitutive and positive autoregulation.

Therefore, entropy production is exclusively governed by the symmetric matrix even in the presence of antisymmetric terms. In this paper we focus on the antisymmetric contributions which describe isentropic oscillations with well-defined equations of motion. The formalism contains variables that are equivalent to momenta and coefficients that are analogous to inertial mass. We apply this formalism to simple problems with known answers such as an oscillating piston containing an ideal gas, and oscillations in an LC-circuit. One can extend this formalism to other pairs of variables, including chemical systems with oscillations. In isentropic thermodynamic systems all extensive and intensive variables including temperature can display oscillations reminiscent of adiabatic waves.},

This strain was used as a recipient to introduce plasmid-encoded heterologous G6PD genes, synthesized in the yeast codon usage and expressed under the control of the native PFK2 promotor. Complementation of the hypersensitivity of the zwf1 mutant towards hydrogen peroxide to different degrees was observed for the genes from humans (HsG6PD1), the milk yeast Kluyveromyces lactis (KlZWF1), the bacteria Escherichia coli (EcZWF1) and Leuconostoc mesenteroides (LmZWF1), as well as the genes encoding three different plant G6PD isoforms from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtG6PD1, AtG6PD5, AtG6PD6). The plastidic AtG6PD1 isoform retained its redox-sensitive activity when produced in the yeast as a cytosolic enzyme, demonstrating the suitability of this host for determination of its physiological properties.

Oscillators are perhaps the simplest motifs that produce time-varying dynamics and are ubiquitous in biological systems. It is also known that such biological oscillators interact with each other\textemdash for instance, circadian oscillators affect the cell cycle, and somitogenesis clock proteins in adjacent cells affect each other in developing embryos. Therefore, it is vital to understand the effects that can emerge from non-linear interaction between oscillations. Here, we show how oscillations typically arise in biology and take the reader on a tour through the great variety in dynamics that can emerge even from a single pair of coupled oscillators. We explain how chaotic dynamics can emerge and outline the methods of detecting this in experimental time traces. Finally, we discuss the potential role of such complex dynamical features in biological systems.},

Our innovation in the DP model is an implementation of a new fast collapsed variational inference procedure which enables us to optimize our variational approximation significantly faster than standard VB approaches. In a biological time series application we show how our model better captures salient features of the data, leading to better consistency with existing biological classifications, while the associated inference algorithm provides a significant speed-up over EM-based variational inference.},

  abstract = {The geophysical literature shows a wide and conflicting usage of methods employed to extract meaningful information on coherent oscillations from measurements. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to relate the findings reported by different authors. Therefore, we have undertaken a critical investigation of the tests and methodology used for determining the presence of statistically significant coherent oscillations in periodograms derived from time series. Statistical significance tests are only valid when performed on the independent frequencies present in a measurement. Both the number of possible independent frequencies in a periodogram and the significance tests are determined by the number of degrees of freedom, which is the number of true independent measurements, present in the time series, rather than the number of sample points in the measurement. The number of degrees of freedom is an intrinsic property of the data, and it must be determined from the serial coherence of the time series. As part of this investigation, a detailed study has been performed which clearly illustrates the deleterious effects that the apparently innocent and commonly used processes of filtering, de-trending, and tapering of data have on periodogram analysis and the consequent difficulties in the interpretation of the statistical significance thus derived. For the sake of clarity, a specific example of actual field measurements containing unevenly-spaced measurements, gaps, etc., as well as synthetic examples, have been used to illustrate the periodogram approach, and pitfalls, leading to the (statistical) significance tests for the presence of coherent oscillations. Among the insights of this investigation are: (1) the concept of a time series being (statistically) band limited by its own serial coherence and thus having a critical sampling rate which defines one of the necessary requirements for the proper statistical design of an experiment; (2) the design of a critical test for the maximum number of significant frequencies which can be used to describe a time series, while retaining intact the variance of the test sample; (3) a demonstration of the unnecessary difficulties that manipulation of the data brings into the statistical significance interpretation of said data; and (4) the resolution and correction of the apparent discrepancy in significance results obtained by the use of the conventional Lomb-Scargle significance test, when compared with the long-standing Schuster-Walker and Fisher tests.},

In this study, the effect of the specific growth rate on the physiology and fermentative capacity of an industrialSaccharomyces cerevisiae strain in aerobic, glucose-limited chemostat cultures was investigated. At specific growth rates (dilution rates, D) below 0.28 h-1, glucose metabolism was fully respiratory. Above this dilution rate, respirofermentative metabolism set in, with ethanol production rates of up to 14 mmol of ethanol {$\cdot$} g of biomass-1 {$\cdot$} h-1at D = 0.40 h-1. A substantial fermentative capacity (assayed offline as ethanol production rate under anaerobic conditions) was found in cultures in which no ethanol was detectable (D {$<$} 0.28 h-1). This fermentative capacity increased with increasing dilution rates, from 10.0 mmol of ethanol {$\cdot$} g of dry yeast biomass-1 {$\cdot$} h-1 at D= 0.025 h-1 to 20.5 mmol of ethanol {$\cdot$} g of dry yeast biomass-1 {$\cdot$} h-1 atD = 0.28 h-1. At even higher dilution rates, the fermentative capacity showed only a small further increase, up to 22.0 mmol of ethanol {$\cdot$} g of dry yeast biomass-1 {$\cdot$} h-1 at D= 0.40 h-1. The activities of all glycolytic enzymes, pyruvate decarboxylase, and alcohol dehydrogenase were determined in cell extracts. Only the in vitro activities of pyruvate decarboxylase and phosphofructokinase showed a clear positive correlation with fermentative capacity. These enzymes are interesting targets for overexpression in attempts to improve the fermentative capacity of aerobic cultures grown at low specific growth rates.},

  abstract = {In the budding yeast S. cerevisiae, commitment to cell division, Start, is promoted by a trio of G1 cyclins, Cln1, Cln2, and Cln3, that activate the CDK kinase Cdc28. The active kinases somehow activate two transcription factors, SBF and MBF, leading to induction of about 100 genes for budding, DNA synthesis, and other early cell cycle processes. Activation of the transcription factors is opposed by a repressive protein called Whi5, and also by a second repressive protein called Stb1. Both Whi5 and Stb1 contain many potential sites for phosphorylation by CDK kinase, and is thought that relief of transcriptional repression involves the phosphorylation of Whi5 and Stb1 by CDK. Phosphorylation site mutants have been studied for Whi5, but not for Stb1. Here, we create phosphorylation site mutants of Stb1, and combine them with site mutants of Whi5. We find that the G1 cyclin Cln3 activates cell cycle transcription effectively when at least one of these proteins has its phosphorylation sites. However, when both Whi5 and Stb1 simultaneously lack all consensus phosphorylation sites, Cln3 is unable, or almost unable, to induce any gene expression, or any advancement of Start. Thus the G1 cyclin signaling pathway to Start has a requirement for CDK phosphorylation sites on either Whi5 or Stb1.},

Owing to its relative biochemical simplicity, the core circadian oscillator in Synechococcus elongatus has become a prototypical system for studying how collective dynamics emerge from molecular interactions. The oscillator consists of only three proteins, KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC, and near-24-h cycles of KaiC phosphorylation can be reconstituted in vitro. Here, we formulate a molecularly-detailed but mechanistically agnostic model of the KaiA-KaiC subsystem and fit it directly to experimental data within a Bayesian parameter estimation framework. Analysis of the fits consistently reveals an ultrasensitive response for KaiC phosphorylation as a function of KaiA concentration, which we confirm experimentally. This ultrasensitivity primarily results from the differential affinity of KaiA for competing nucleotide-bound states of KaiC. We argue that the ultrasensitive stimulus-response relation is critical to metabolic compensation by suppressing premature phosphorylation at nighttime.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In this study, we attempted to identify novel mitochondrially localized proteins in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae using a fluorescent protein (GFPdeg) that is rapidly degraded in the cytoplasm. Of the budding yeast proteins predicted to localize to mitochondria by the prediction tool Deeploc-1.0, those with known mitochondrial localization or functional relevance were eliminated, and 95 proteins of unknown function were selected as candidates for analysis. By forced expression of GFPdeg fusion proteins with these proteins and observation of their localization, we identified 35 uncharacterized proteins potentially localized to mitochondria (UPMs) including 8 previously identified proteins that localize to mitochondria. Most of these had no N-terminal mitochondrial localization signal and were evolutionarily young ``emerging genes'' that exist only in S. cerevisiae. Some of these genes were found to be upregulated during the postdiauxic shift phase when mitochondria are being developed, suggesting that they are actually involved in some mitochondrial function.},

The effects of varying substrate concentration and oxygen concentration on the observed cell mass signals are eliminated by direct measurement of cell mass, as opposed to indirect measurement schemes such as those using NADH fluorescence. The sensor is robust and able to undergo many cycles of in situ steam sterilization without degradation, and its fluorescence signal is linear with concentration for all species studied in this work.

Here we show that under constant calcium stress, nuclear localization pulses of the transcription factor Crz1 follow stochastic variations in cytosolic calcium concentration. We find that the size of the stochastic calcium bursts is positively correlated with the number of subsequent Crz1 pulses. Based on our observations, we propose a simple stochastic model of how the signaling pathway converts a constant external calcium concentration into a digital number of Crz1 pulses in the nucleus, due to the time delay from nuclear transport and the stochastic decoherence of individual Crz1 molecule dynamics. We find support for several additional predictions of the model and suggest that stochastic input to nuclear transport may produce noisy digital responses to analog signals in other signaling systems.},

  abstract = {Pho85 is a multifunctional cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that has emerged as an important model for the role of Cdks in both cell cycle control and other processes. Pho85 is targeted to its substrates by 10 different cyclins or Pcls. Three of these Pcls have specific roles in G1 phase of the cell cycle, both in regulating G1-specific gene expression and in controlling polarized growth. Many known substrates of the G1 forms of Pho85 are also phosphorylated by the homologous Cdk Cln\textendash Cdc28, suggesting parallel or overlapping roles. Most of the remaining Pcls function in signalling: Pho85 is generally active when environmental conditions are satisfactory, phosphorylating proteins involved in transcription and other regulatory events to keep the stress response and inappropriate activities turned off. Recently, genetic screens for synthetic lethality and synthetic dosage lethality, and proteomic screens for in vitro Pho85 substrates, have revealed more details about how Pho85 functions to regulate a variety of cellular processes.},

These methods hold significant promise for future discovery, particularly when combined with computational modeling. However, genome-scale experiments are costly and laborious, yielding ``big data'' that are conceptually and statistically difficult to analyze. There is no obvious consensus regarding design or analysis. Here we discuss the relevant technical considerations to generate reproducible, statistically sound, and broadly useful genome-scale data. Rather than suggest a set of rigid rules, we aim to codify principles by which investigators, reviewers, and readers of the primary literature can evaluate the suitability of different experimental designs for measuring different aspects of biological rhythms. We introduce CircaInSilico, a web-based application for generating synthetic genome biology data to benchmark statistical methods for studying biological rhythms. Finally, we discuss several unmet analytical needs, including applications to clinical medicine, and suggest productive avenues to address them.},

  abstract = {Circadian rhythms are oscillations of physiology, behavior, and metabolism that have period lengths near 24 hours. In several model organisms and humans, circadian clock genes have been characterized and found to be transcription factors. Because of this, researchers have used microarrays to characterize global regulation of gene expression and algorithmic approaches to detect cycling. This article presents a new algorithm, JTK\_CYCLE, designed to efficiently identify and characterize cycling variables in large data sets. Compared with COSOPT and the Fisher's G test, two commonly used methods for detecting cycling transcripts, JTK\_CYCLE distinguishes between rhythmic and nonrhythmic transcripts more reliably and efficiently. JTK\_CYCLE's increased resistance to outliers results in considerably greater sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, JTK\_CYCLE accurately measures the period, phase, and amplitude of cycling transcripts, facilitating downstream analyses. Finally, JTK\_CYCLE is several orders of magnitude faster than COSOPT, making it ideal for large-scale data sets. JTK\_CYCLE was used to analyze legacy data sets including NIH3T3 cells, which have comparatively low amplitude oscillations. JTK\_CYCLE's improved power led to the identification of a novel cluster of RNA-interacting genes whose abundance is under clear circadian regulation. These data suggest that JTK\_CYCLE is an ideal tool for identifying and characterizing oscillations in genome-scale data sets.},

Here we develop a statistically rigorous, Bayesian approach to infer the optimal partitioning of a data set into contiguous piece-wise linear segments. Our nunchaku algorithm is freely available. Focusing on microbial growth, we use nunchaku to identify the range of optical density where the density is linearly proportional to the number of cells and to automatically find the regions of exponential growth for both Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. For budding yeast, we consequently are able to infer the Monod constant for growth on fructose. Our algorithm lends itself to automation and high throughput studies, increases reproducibility, and will facilitate data analysis for a broad range of scientists.},

  abstract = {Robust methods for identifying patterns of expression in genome-wide data are important for generating hypotheses regarding gene function. To this end, several analytic methods have been developed for detecting periodic patterns. We improve one such method, JTK\_CYCLE, by explicitly calculating the null distribution such that it accounts for multiple hypothesis testing and by including non-sinusoidal reference waveforms. We term this method empirical JTK\_CYCLE with asymmetry search, and we compare its performance to JTK\_CYCLE with Bonferroni and Benjamini-Hochberg multiple hypothesis testing correction, as well as to five other methods: cyclohedron test, address reduction, stable persistence, ANOVA, and F24. We find that ANOVA, F24, and JTK\_CYCLE consistently outperform the other three methods when data are limited and noisy; empirical JTK\_CYCLE with asymmetry search gives the greatest sensitivity while controlling for the false discovery rate. Our analysis also provides insight into experimental design and we find that, for a fixed number of samples, better sensitivity and specificity are achieved with higher numbers of replicates than with higher sampling density. Application of the methods to detecting circadian rhythms in a metadataset of microarrays that quantify time-dependent gene expression in whole heads of Drosophila melanogaster reveals annotations that are enriched among genes with highly asymmetric waveforms. These include a wide range of oxidation reduction and metabolic genes, as well as genes with transcripts that have multiple splice forms.},

  abstract = {Eukaryotic cells decide in late G1 whether to commit to another round of genome duplication and division. This point of irreversible cell cycle commitment is a molecular switch termed ``Restriction Point'' in mammals and ``Start'' in budding yeast. At Start, yeast cells integrate multiple signals such as pheromones, osmolarity, and nutrients. If sufficient nutrients are lacking, cells will not pass Start. However, how the cells respond to nutrient depletion after they have made the Start decision, remains poorly understood. Here, we analyze by live cell imaging how post-Start yeast cells respond to nutrient depletion. We monitor fluorescently labelled Whi5, the cell cycle inhibitor whose export from the nucleus determines Start. Surprisingly, we find that cells that have passed Start can re-import Whi5 back into the nucleus. This occurs when cells are faced with starvation up to 20 minutes after Start. In these cells, the positive feedback loop is interrupted, Whi5 re-binds DNA, and CDK activation occurs a second time once nutrients are replenished. Cells which re-import Whi5 also become sensitive to mating pheromone again, and thus behave like pre-Start cells. In summary, we show that upon starvation the commitment decision at Start can be reversed. We therefore propose that in yeast, as has been suggested for mammalian cells, cell cycle commitment is a multi-step process, where irreversibility in face of nutrient signaling is only reached approximately 20 minutes after CDK activation at Start.},

  abstract = {Heme is an oxygen carrier and a cofactor of both industrial enzymes and food additives. The intracellular level of free heme is low, which limits the synthesis of heme proteins. Therefore, increasing heme synthesis allows an increased production of heme proteins. Using the genome-scale metabolic model (GEM) Yeast8 for the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we identified fluxes potentially important to heme synthesis. With this model, in silico simulations highlighted 84 gene targets for balancing biomass and increasing heme production. Of those identified, 76 genes were individually deleted or overexpressed in experiments. Empirically, 40 genes individually increased heme production (up to threefold). Heme was increased by modifying target genes, which not only included the genes involved in heme biosynthesis, but also those involved in glycolysis, pyruvate, Fe-S clusters, glycine, and succinyl-coenzyme A (CoA) metabolism. Next, we developed an algorithmic method for predicting an optimal combination of these genes by using the enzyme-constrained extension of the Yeast8 model, ecYeast8. The computationally identified combination for enhanced heme production was evaluated using the heme ligand-binding biosensor (Heme-LBB). The positive targets were combined using CRISPR-Cas9 in the yeast strain (IMX581-HEM15-HEM14-HEM3-{$\Delta$}shm1-HEM2-{$\Delta$}hmx1-FET4-{$\Delta$}gcv2-HEM1-{$\Delta$}gcv1-HEM13), which produces 70-fold-higher levels of intracellular heme.},

Vasomotion occurs consequent to oscillations of the contractile state of the smooth muscle cells in the vascular wall and is present in most small arteries in the body. Vasomotion can occur via mechanisms intrinsic to the vascular wall and can consequently be studied in arteries isolated from the body and mounted in an organ chamber. The prevalence of vasomotion is highest in situations where the flow to an organ is compromised. It seems likely that vasomotion is beneficial and ensures an improved dialysis of the tissue, i.e. more efficient delivery of oxygen and removal of waste product, although there is still a need for more experimental evidence to confirm this.},

In yeast, how metabolic signals control the progressive establishment of structural reorganizations observed in quiescent cells remains unclear. To address this question, we have developed a method that combines nutrient-limited proliferation assays at the population level with single-cell tracking to unravel the coordination between metabolic and structural transitions in cells during an unperturbed lifecycle. We show that non-monotonous internal pH fluctuations are in sync with successive waves of protein super-assemblies formation and ultimately lead to a cytosolic glass transition. Our results, therefore, suggest a simple model explaining how the complex developmental changes during the yeast life cycle are orchestrated by the sequence of metabolic transitions.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

This led to the question of where and how the ratio-sensing is achieved. Here, we consider the possibilities of an intracellular, extracellular, or membrane bound ratio sensing mechanisms. We show that hexose transporters in the plasma membrane are mainly responsible for glucose/galactose ratio-sensing in yeast. Further, while the glucose sensors Gpr1, Snf3, and Rgt2 are not required for ratio sensing, they help modulate the ratio sensing phenotype by regulating the expression of individual transporters in different environments. Our study provides an example of an unexpected, but potentially widespread, mechanism for making essential decisions.},

  abstract = {Glucose metabolism has been studied extensively to understand functional interplays between metabolism and a cell cycle. However, our understanding of cell cycle-dependent metabolic adaptation particularly in human cells remains largely elusive. Meanwhile, human enzymes in glucose metabolism are shown to functionally organize into three different sizes of a multienzyme metabolic assembly, the glucosome, to regulate glucose flux in a size-dependent manner. Here, using fluorescence single-cell imaging techniques, we discover that glucosomes spatiotemporally oscillate during a cell cycle in an assembly size-dependent manner. Importantly, their oscillation at single-cell levels is in accordance with functional contributions of glucose metabolism to cell cycle progression at a population level. Collectively, we demonstrate functional oscillation of glucosomes during cell cycle progression and thus their biological significance to human cell biology.},

  abstract = {Transcriptional repression can occur via various mechanisms, such as blocking, sequestration and displacement. For instance, the repressors can hold the activators to prevent binding with DNA or can bind to the DNA-bound activators to block their transcriptional activity. Although the transcription can be completely suppressed with a single mechanism, multiple repression mechanisms are used together to inhibit transcriptional activators in many systems, such as circadian clocks and NF-{$\kappa$}B oscillators. This raises the question of what advantages arise if seemingly redundant repression mechanisms are combined. Here, by deriving equations describing the multiple repression mechanisms, we find that their combination can synergistically generate a sharply ultrasensitive transcription response and thus strong oscillations. This rationalizes why the multiple repression mechanisms are used together in various biological oscillators. The critical role of such combined transcriptional repression for strong oscillations is further supported by our analysis of formerly identified mutations disrupting the transcriptional repression of the mammalian circadian clock. The hitherto unrecognized source of the ultrasensitivity, the combined transcriptional repressions, can lead to robust synthetic oscillators with a previously unachievable simple design.},

  abstract = {Unlike many single-celled organisms, the growth of fission yeast cells within a cell cycle is not exponential. It is rather characterized by three distinct phases (elongation, septation, and reshaping), each with a different growth rate. Experiments also showed that the distribution of cell size in a lineage can be bimodal, unlike the unimodal distributions measured for the bacterium Escherichia coli. Here we construct a detailed stochastic model of cell size dynamics in fission yeast. The theory leads to analytic expressions for the cell size and the birth size distributions, and explains the origin of bimodality seen in experiments. In particular, our theory shows that the left peak in the bimodal distribution is associated with cells in the elongation phase, while the right peak is due to cells in the septation and reshaping phases. We show that the size control strategy, the variability in the added size during a cell cycle, and the fraction of time spent in each of the three cell growth phases have a strong bearing on the shape of the cell size distribution. Furthermore, we infer all the parameters of our model by matching the theoretical cell size and birth size distributions to those from experimental single-cell time-course data for seven different growth conditions. Our method provides a much more accurate means of determining the size control strategy (timer, adder or sizer) than the standard method based on the slope of the best linear fit between the birth and division sizes. We also show that the variability in added size and the strength of size control in fission yeast depend weakly on the temperature but strongly on the culture medium. More importantly, we find that stronger size homeostasis and larger added size variability are required for fission yeast to adapt to unfavorable environmental conditions.},

A triphasic stochastic bifurcation is observed upon increasing the ratio of the positive and negative feedback strengths, which reveals a strong synergistic interaction between positive and negative feedback loops. We discover that coupled positive-plus-negative feedback amplifies gene expression mean but reduces gene expression noise over a wide range of feedback strengths when promoter switching is relatively slow, stabilizing gene expression around a relatively high level. In addition, we study two types of macroscopic limits of the discrete chemical master equation model: the Kurtz limit applies to proteins with large burst frequencies and the L\'evy limit applies to proteins with large burst sizes. We derive the analytic steady-state distributions of the protein abundance in a coupled gene circuit for both the discrete model and its two macroscopic limits, generalizing the results obtained by Liu et al. [Chaos 26, 043108 (2016)]. We also obtain the analytic time-dependent protein distribution for the classical Friedman-Cai-Xie random bursting model [Friedman, Cai, and Xie, Phys. Rev.

Using six illustrative examples of entrainable biological oscillators, we discuss the distinctions between entrainment and synchrony and explore features that contribute to a system's propensity to entrain. Entrainment can either enhance or reduce the heterogeneity of oscillations within a cell population, and we provide examples and mechanisms of each case. Finally, we discuss the known functions of entrainment and discuss potential functions from an evolutionary perspective.},

  abstract = {Constraint-based modeling has risen as an alternative for characterizing the metabolism of communities. Adaptations of Flux Balance Analysis have been proposed to model metabolic interactions in most cases, considering a unique optimal flux distribution derived from the maximization of biomass production. However, these approaches do not consider the development of other potentially novel essential functions not directly related to cell growth which forces them to display suboptimal growth rates in nature. Additionally, suboptimal states allow a degree of plasticity in the metabolism, thus allowing quick shifts between alternative flux distributions as an initial response to environmental changes. In this work, we present a method to explore the abundance-growth space as a representation of metabolic flux distributions of a community. This space is defined by the composition of a community, represented by its members' relative abundance and their growth rate. The analysis of this space allows us to represent the whole set of feasible fluxes without needing a complete description of the solution space unveiling abundance-dependent metabolic phenotypes displayed in a given environment. As an illustration, we consider a community composed of two bioleaching bacteria, Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans Wenelen and Sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans Cutipay, finding that changes in the composition of their available resources significantly affects their metabolic plasticity. IMPORTANCE In nature, organisms live in communities and not as isolated species. Their interactions provide a source of resilience to environmental disturbances. Despite their importance in ecology, human health, and industry, understanding how organisms interact in different environments remains an open question.In this work, we provide a novel approach which, only using genomics information, studies the metabolic phenotype exhibited by communities, where the exploration of suboptimal growth flux distributions and the composition of a community allows to unveil its capacity to respond to environmental changes, shedding the light of the degree of metabolic plasticity inherent to the community.},

Moreover, the yeast vacuole/lysosome is necessary for progression of the cell division cycle, in part via signaling through the TORC1 pathway. Here, we show that an essential cyclin-dependent kinase, Bur1, plays a critical role in cell cycle progression in cooperation with TORC1. A mutation in BUR1 combined with a defect in vacuole inheritance shows a synthetic growth defect. Importantly, the double mutant, as well as a bur1-267 mutant on its own, has a severe defect in cell cycle progression from G1 phase. In further support that BUR1 functions with TORC1, mutation of bur1 alone results in high sensitivity to rapamycin, a TORC1 inhibitor. Mechanistic insight for Bur1 function comes from the findings that Bur1 directly phosphorylates Sch9, a target of TORC1, and that both Bur1 and TORC1 are required for the activation of Sch9. Together, these discoveries suggest that multiple signals converge on Sch9 to promote cell cycle progression.},

  abstract = {Iron is a vital micronutrient that functions as an essential cofactor in multiple biological processes, including oxygen transport, cellular respiration, and metabolic pathways, such as sterol biosynthesis. However, its low bioavailability at physiological pH frequently leads to nutritional iron deficiency. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is extensively used to study iron and lipid metabolisms, as well as in multiple biotechnological applications. Despite iron being indispensable for yeast ergosterol biosynthesis and growth, little is known about their interconnections. Here, we used lipid composition analyses to determine that changes in the pattern of sterols impair the response to iron deprivation of yeast cells. Yeast mutants defective in ergosterol biosynthesis display defects in the transcriptional activation of the iron-acquisition machinery and growth defects in iron-depleted conditions. The transcriptional activation function of the iron-sensing Aft1 factor is interrupted due to its mislocalization to the vacuole. These data uncover novel links between iron and sterol metabolisms that need to be considered when producing yeast-derived foods or when treating fungal infections with drugs that target the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway.},

Genetic analysis revealed a complex network of newly found factors that govern critical cell size at Start, the most potent of which were Sfp1, Sch9, Cdh1, Prs3, and Whi5. Ribosome biogenesis is intimately linked to cell size through Sfp1, a transcription factor that controls the expression of at least 60 genes implicated in ribosome assembly.

After presenting the FN approach, they show how a well-known system of glucose consumption and utilization by yeast can be modeled, analyzed and controlled. Then, FNs are used to build and analyze the first quantitative and predictive model of Wilson disease (a heritable defect in copper utilization). They demonstrate that FN simulations permit an evaluation of the relative efficacy of different therapeutic options.},

A GFN consists of an event net that determines how the state changes as processes execute, and an intensity net that determines the speeds of the processes. In a GFN, the continuous state is given by the value of its state variables, and the discrete state is given by the region within which such variables lie.

We further show how scPrisma can be used to distinguish mixed cellular populations by specific characteristics such as cell type, and uncover regulatory networks and cell-cell interactions specific to predefined biological signals, such as the circadian rhythm. We show scPrisma{${'}$}s flexibility in utilizing diverse prior knowledge, and inference of topologically-informative genes. scPrisma can be used both as a stand-alone workflow for signal analysis, and, as it does not embed the data to lower dimensions, as a prior step for downstream single-cell analysis.},

The low-complexity (LC) domain of Pbp1 forms labile, cross-{$\beta$} polymers that facilitate phase transition of~the protein into liquid-like or gel-like states. Phase~transition for other LC domains is reliant upon widely distributed aromatic amino acids. In place of tyrosine or phenylalanine residues prototypically used for phase separation, Pbp1 contains 24 similarly disposed methionine residues. Here, we show that the Pbp1 methionine residues are sensitive to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-mediated oxidation in~vitro and in living cells. Methionine oxidation melts Pbp1 liquid-like droplets in a manner reversed by methionine sulfoxide reductase enzymes. These observations explain how reversible formation of labile polymers by the Pbp1 LC domain enables the protein to function as a sensor of cellular redox state.},

  abstract = {Background The efficacy of antibiotics against M. tuberculosis has been shown to be influenced by experimental media conditions. Investigations of M. tuberculosis growth in physiological conditions have described an environment that is different from common in vitro media. Thus, elucidating the interplay between available nutrient sources and antibiotic efficacy has clear medical relevance. While genome-scale reconstructions of M. tuberculosis have enabled the ability to interrogate media differences for the past 10~years, recent reconstructions have diverged from each other without standardization. A unified reconstruction of M. tuberculosis H37Rv would elucidate the impact of different nutrient conditions on antibiotic efficacy and provide new insights for therapeutic intervention. Results We present a new genome-scale model of M. tuberculosis H37Rv, named iEK1011, that unifies and updates previous M. tuberculosis H37Rv genome-scale reconstructions. We functionally assess iEK1011 against previous models and show that the model increases correct gene essentiality predictions on two different experimental datasets by 6\% (53\% to 60\%) and 18\% (60\% to 71\%), respectively. We compared simulations between in vitro and approximated in vivo media conditions to examine the predictive capabilities of iEK1011. The simulated differences recapitulated literature defined characteristics in the rewiring of TCA metabolism including succinate secretion, gluconeogenesis, and activation of both the glyoxylate shunt and the methylcitrate cycle. To assist efforts to elucidate mechanisms of antibiotic resistance development, we curated 16 metabolic genes related to antimicrobial resistance and approximated evolutionary drivers of resistance. Comparing simulations of these antibiotic resistance features between in vivo and in vitro media highlighted condition-dependent differences that may influence the efficacy of antibiotics. Conclusions iEK1011 provides a computational knowledge base for exploring the impact of different environmental conditions on the metabolic state of M. tuberculosis H37Rv. As more experimental data and knowledge of M. tuberculosis H37Rv become available, a unified and standardized M. tuberculosis model will prove to be a valuable resource to the research community studying the systems biology of M. tuberculosis.

  abstract = {Pah1 phosphatidate (PA) phosphatase plays a major role in triacylglycerol synthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by producing its precursor diacylglycerol, and concurrently regulates de novo phospholipid synthesis by consuming its precursor PA. The function of Pah1 requires its membrane localization, which is controlled by its phosphorylation state. Whereas Pah1 is dephosphorylated by the Nem1-Spo7 protein phosphatase, its phosphorylation occurs by multiple known and unknown protein kinases. In this work, we show that Rim11, a yeast homolog of mammalian glycogen synthase kinase-3{$\beta$}, is a protein kinase that phosphorylates Pah1 on serine (Ser-12, Ser-602, and Ser-818) and threonine (Thr-163, Thr-164, Thr-522) residues. Enzymological characterization of Rim11 showed that its Km for Pah1 (0.4 {$\mu$}M) is similar to those of other Pah1-phosphorylating protein kinases, but its Km for ATP (30 {$\mu$}M) is significantly higher than those of these same kinases. Furthermore, we demonstrate Rim11 phosphorylation of Pah1 does not require substrate prephosphorylation, but was increased {$\sim$}2-fold upon its prephosphorylation by the Pho85-Pho80 protein kinase. In addition, we show Rim11-phosphorylated Pah1 was a substrate for dephosphorylation by Nem1-Spo7. Finally, we demonstrate the Rim11 phosphorylation of Pah1 exerted an inhibitory effect on its PA phosphatase activity by reduction of its catalytic efficiency. Mutational analysis of the major phosphorylation sites (Thr-163, Thr-164, and Ser-602) indicated that Rim11-mediated phosphorylation at these sites was required to ensure Nem1-Spo7-dependent localization of the enzyme to the membrane. Overall, these findings advance our understanding of the phosphorylation-mediated regulation of Pah1 function in lipid synthesis.},

  abstract = {The yeast phosphatidic acid (PA) phosphatase, Pah1, regulates the synthesis of triacylglycerol (TAG) and phospholipids by controlling the relative amounts of its substrate PA and product diacylglycerol. Pah1 phosphorylation, which is mediated by multiple protein kinases, has been shown to protect the protein against proteasomal degradation and regulates its localization and catalytic activity. Phosphorylated Pah1 is cytoplasmic, but it translocates to the nuclear/endoplasmic reticulum membrane for catalytic function through its dephosphorylation. In this study, we show that Rim11, a yeast homolog of glycogen synthase kinase phosphorylates Pah1. The rim11{$\Delta$} mutant shows alterations in lipid composition with elevated TAG levels during exponential growth, the phase in which Rim11 is the most abundant. Rim11 purified from yeast phosphorylated Escherichia coli-expressed Pah1, which lacks endogenous phosphorylation, in a manner that is dependent on reaction time and the amounts of Rim11, Pah1, and ATP. Phosphoamino acid analysis and phosphopeptide mapping showed that Pah1 phosphorylation by Rim11 occurs at multiple serine and threonine residues, which was supported by mass spectrometry analysis which indicated that Rim11 has a major phosphorylation site that is shared with multiple kinases (Ser-602) and two unique minor phosphorylation sites (Thr-163 and Thr-164). Furthermore, in vitro PA phosphatase assays show that Pah1 catalytic activity is inhibited following phosphorylation by Rim11.},

  abstract = {Amphibacillus xylanus is a recently identified bacterium which grows well under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions and may prove useful for biomass utilization. Amphibacillus xylanus, despite lacking a respiratory chain, consumes oxygen at a similar rate to Escherichia coli (130\textendash 140 {$\mu$}mol oxygen{$\cdot$}min-1{$\cdot$}g-1 dry cells at 37 \textdegree C), suggesting that it has an alternative system that uses a large amount of oxygen. Amphibacillus xylanus NADH oxidase (Nox) was previously reported to rapidly reduce molecular oxygen content in the presence of exogenously added free flavin. Here, we established a quantitative method for determining the intracellular concentrations of free flavins in A. xylanus, involving French pressure and ultrafiltration membranes. The intracellular concentrations of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), flavin mononucleotide (FMN), and riboflavin were estimated to be approximately 8, 3, and 1 {$\mu$}m, respectively. In the presence of FAD, the predominant free flavin species, two flavoproteins Nox (which binds FAD) and NAD(P)H oxidoreductase (Npo, which binds FMN), were identified as central free flavin-associated enzymes in the oxygen metabolic pathway. Under 8 {$\mu$}m free FAD, the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of recombinant Nox and Npo for oxygen increased by approximately fivefold and ninefold, respectively. Nox and Npo levels were increased, and intracellular FAD formation was stimulated following exposure of A. xylanus to oxygen. This suggests that these two enzymes and free FAD contribute to effective oxygen detoxification and NAD(P)+ regeneration to maintain redox balance during aerobic growth. Furthermore, A. xylanus required iron to grow aerobically. We also discuss the contribution of the free flavin-associated system to the process of iron utilization.},

  abstract = {Elucidating the role of molecular stochasticity1 in cellular growth is central to understanding phenotypic heterogeneity2 and the stability of cellular proliferation3. The inherent stochasticity of metabolic reaction events4 should have negligible effect, because of averaging over the many reaction events contributing to growth. Indeed, metabolism and growth are often considered to be constant for fixed conditions5,6. Stochastic fluctuations in the expression level1,7,8,9 of metabolic enzymes could produce variations in the reactions they catalyse. However, whether such molecular fluctuations can affect growth is unclear, given the various stabilizing regulatory mechanisms10,11,12, the slow adjustment of key cellular components such as ribosomes13,14, and the secretion15 and buffering16,17 of excess metabolites. Here we use time-lapse microscopy to measure fluctuations in the instantaneous growth rate of single cells of Escherichia coli, and quantify time-resolved cross-correlations with the expression of lac genes and enzymes in central metabolism. We show that expression fluctuations of catabolically active enzymes can propagate and cause growth fluctuations, with transmission depending on the limitation of the enzyme to growth. Conversely, growth fluctuations propagate back to perturb expression. Accordingly, enzymes were found to transmit noise to other unrelated genes via growth. Homeostasis is promoted by a noise-cancelling mechanism that exploits fluctuations in the dilution of proteins by cell-volume expansion. The results indicate that molecular noise is propagated not only by regulatory proteins18,19 but also by metabolic reactions. They also suggest that cellular metabolism is inherently stochastic, and a generic source of phenotypic heterogeneity.},

As a result, stochastic fluctuations in expression levels and instantaneous growth rate show intricate cross-correlations. These correlations are shaped by feedback loops, trade-offs and constraints acting at the cellular level; therefore a quantitative understanding requires an integrated approach. To that end, we here present a mathematical model describing a cell that contains multiple proteins that are each expressed stochastically and jointly limit the growth rate. Conversely, metabolism and growth affect protein synthesis and dilution. Thus, expression noise originating in one gene propagates to metabolism, growth, and the expression of all other genes. Nevertheless, under a small-noise approximation many statistical quantities can be calculated analytically. We identify several routes of noise propagation, illustrate their origins and scaling, and establish important connections between noise propagation and the field of metabolic control analysis. We then present a many-protein model containing {$>$}1000 proteins parameterized by previously measured abundance data and demonstrate that the predicted cross-correlations between gene expression and growth rate are in broad agreement with published measurements.},

Notwithstanding, little is known about the cellular buffer and redox systems in aging Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is a model for aging stem cells. Using genetically encoded fluorescent sensors, we measured pH, H2O2 levels and the glutathione redox potential compartment-specific in the cytosol of living, replicatively aging yeast cells, growing under fermenting and respiratory conditions until the end of their lifespan. We found that the pH decreases under both conditions at later stages of the replicative lifespan. H2O2 levels increase in fermenting cells in the post-replicative stage, but increase continuously with age in respiring cells. The glutathione redox couple becomes also more oxidizing in respiring cells but surprisingly more reducing under fermenting conditions. In strains deleted for the gene encoding glutathione reductase Glr1, such a reduction of the glutathione redox couple with age is not observed. We demonstrate that in vivo Glr1 is activated at lower pH explaining the reduced glutathione potential. The deletion of glr1 dramatically increases the glutathione redox potential especially under respiratory conditions but does not reduce lifespan. Our data demonstrate that pH and the glutathione redox couple is linked through Glr1 and that yeast cells can cope with a high glutathione redox potential without impact on longevity. Our data further suggest that a breakdown of cellular energy metabolism marks the end of replicative lifespan in yeast.},

For example, they are subject to periodic modulation by the cell cycle through volume growth and gene doubling. To investigate possible effects of the cell cycle on oscillatory gene circuits dynamics, we modelled a simple synthetic genetic oscillator, the repressilator, and studied hallmarks of the resulting nonlinear dynamics. We found that the repressilator coupled to the cell cycle shows typical quasiperiodic motion with discrete Fourier spectra and windows in parameter space with synchronization of the two oscillators, with a devil's stair case indicating the Arnold tongues of synchronization. In the case of identical parameters for the three genes of the repressilator and simultaneous gene duplication, we identify two classes of synchronization windows, symmetric and asymmetric, depending on whether the trajectories satisfy a discrete three-fold rotation symmetry, corresponding to cyclic permutation of the three genes. Unexpectedly changing the gene doubling time revealed that the width of the Arnold tongues is connected to that three-fold symmetry of the synchronization trajectories: non-simultaneous gene duplication increases the width of asymmetric synchronization regions, for some of them by an order of magnitude. By contrast, there is only a small or even a negative effect on the window size for symmetric synchronization. This observation points to a control mechanism of synchronization via the location of the genes on the chromosome.},

Thus far only Lot6p was characterized in detail demonstrating that the enzyme possesses NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase activity. In the present study, we heterologously expressed PST2 in Escherichia coli and purified the produced protein to conduct a detailed biochemical and structural characterization. Determination of the three-dimensional structure by X-ray crystallography revealed that Pst2p adopts the flavodoxin-like fold and forms tetramers independent of cofactor binding. The lack of electron density for FMN indicated weak binding, which was confirmed by further biochemical analysis yielding a dissociation constant of 20{$\pm$}1{$\mu$}M. The redox potential of FMN bound to Pst2p was determined to -89{$\pm$}3mV and is thus 119mV more positive than that of free FMN indicating that reduced FMN binds ca. five orders of magnitude tighter to Pst2p than oxidized FMN. Due to this rather positive redox potential Pst2p is unable to reduce free FMN or azo dyes as reported for other members of the flavodoxin-like protein family. On the other hand, Pst2p efficiently catalyzes the NAD(P)H dependent two-electron reduction of natural and artificial quinones. The kinetic mechanism follows a ping-pong bi-bi reaction scheme. In vivo experiments with a PST2 knock out and overexpressing strain demonstrated that Pst2p enables yeast cells to cope with quinone-induced damage suggesting a role of the enzyme in managing oxidative stress.},

  abstract = {Purine auxotrophy is an abundant trait among eukaryotic parasites and a typical marker for many budding yeast strains. Supplementation with an additional purine source (such as adenine) is necessary to cultivate these strains. If not supplied in adequate amounts, purine starvation sets in. We explored purine starvation effects in a model organism, a budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae\&nbsp;ade8 knockout, at the level of cellular morphology, central carbon metabolism, and global transcriptome. We observed that purine-starved cells stopped their cycle in G1/G0 state and accumulated trehalose, and the intracellular concentration of AXP decreased, but adenylate charge remained stable. Cells became tolerant to severe environmental stresses. Intracellular RNA concentration decreased, and massive downregulation of ribosomal biosynthesis genes occurred. We proved that the expression of new proteins during purine starvation is critical for cells to attain stress tolerance phenotype Msn2/4p targets are upregulated in purine-starved cells when compared to cells cultivated in purine-rich media. The overall transcriptomic response to purine starvation resembles that of stationary phase cells. Our results demonstrate that the induction of a strong stress resistance phenotype in budding yeast can be caused not only by natural starvation, but also starvation for metabolic intermediates, such as purines.},

  abstract = {Global control for the synthesis of lipids constituting a bilayer of cell membranes is known to be with a small number of transcription factors called master transcriptional regulators, which target a wide range of genes encoding lipid metabolism enzymes and/or their regulators. Although master transcriptional regulators of glycerophospholipids and sterols have been identified in both yeast and mammals, this aspect of sphingolipid metabolism is not yet understood. In the present study, we identified the C2H2-type zinc finger transcription factor, Com2, as a master transcriptional regulator of sphingolipid metabolism in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The target of rapamycin complex 2 (TORC2)-activated protein kinase Ypk1 is known to regulate sphingolipid metabolism. Activated Ypk1 stimulates the activity of serine palmitoyl transferase (SPT), the first-step enzyme in sphingolipid biosynthesis, by phosphorylating and inhibiting Orm1/2, a negative regulator of SPT. This regulation of SPT activity is thought to be a major pathway in the regulation of sphingolipid metabolism. In the present study, we found that inhibition of sphingolipid synthesis upregulates the expression of Com2, which in turn leads to the concomitant expression of Ypk1. The upregulation of Ypk1 expression was found to be dependent on a putative Com2-binding site in the YPK1 promoter. Our results also suggested that Com2 senses intracellular sphingolipid levels through a pathway independent of TORC2-Ypk1-mediated sensing of sphingolipids. Our results revealed an additional layer of mechanistic regulation that allows cells to maintain appropriate levels of sphingolipid biosynthesis and to rapidly induce this process in response to environmental stresses. Significance Statement One of the major regulatory mechanisms involved in the control of lipid metabolism in bilayers of biological membranes is regulation at the transcriptional level by master transcriptional regulators that control the transcription of genes encoding lipid metabolism enzymes and/or their regulators. In the present study, we identified the C2H2-type zinc finger transcription factor Com2 as a master transcriptional regulator in sphingolipid metabolism. We found that Com2 regulates sphingolipid metabolism by transcriptionally controlling the expression of Ypk1, which regulates Orm1/2, a negative regulator of serine palmitoyl transferase, the first-step enzyme in sphingolipid biosynthesis, through phosphorylation. Our study revealed a new layer of regulation that allows the maintenance of an appropriate level of sphingolipid biosynthesis for a rapid response to environmental stresses.},

  abstract = {Growth kinetics, i.e., the relationship between specific growth rate and the concentration of a substrate, is one of the basic tools in microbiology. However, despite more than half a century of research, many fundamental questions about the validity and application of growth kinetics as observed in the laboratory to environmental growth conditions are still unanswered. For pure cultures growing with single substrates, enormous inconsistencies exist in the growth kinetic data reported. The low quality of experimental data has so far hampered the comparison and validation of the different growth models proposed, and only recently have data collected from nutrient-controlled chemostat cultures allowed us to compare different kinetic models on a statistical basis. The problems are mainly due to (i) the analytical difficulty in measuring substrates at growth-controlling concentrations and (ii) the fact that during a kinetic experiment, particularly in batch systems, microorganisms alter their kinetic properties because of adaptation to the changing environment. For example, for Escherichia coli growing with glucose, a physiological long-term adaptation results in a change in KS for glucose from some 5 mg liter-1 to ca. 30 {$\mu$}g liter-1. The data suggest that a dilemma exists, namely, that either ``intrinsic'' KS (under substrate-controlled conditions in chemostat culture) or {$\mu$}max (under substrate-excess conditions in batch culture) can be measured but both cannot be determined at the same time. The above-described conventional growth kinetics derived from single-substrate-controlled laboratory experiments have invariably been used for describing both growth and substrate utilization in ecosystems. However, in nature, microbial cells are exposed to a wide spectrum of potential substrates, many of which they utilize simultaneously (in particular carbon sources). The kinetic data available to date for growth of pure cultures in carbon-controlled continuous culture with defined mixtures of two or more carbon sources (including pollutants) clearly demonstrate that simultaneous utilization results in lowered residual steady-state concentrations of all substrates. This should result in a competitive advantage of a cell capable of mixed-substrate growth because it can grow much faster at low substrate concentrations than one would expect from single-substrate kinetics. Additionally, the relevance of the kinetic principles obtained from defined culture systems with single, mixed, or multicomponent substrates to the kinetics of pollutant degradation as it occurs in the presence of alternative carbon sources in complex environmental systems is discussed. The presented overview indicates that many of the environmentally relevant apects in growth kinetics are still waiting to be discovered, established, and exploited.},

From the yeast metabolic cycles, metabolic oscillations in oxygen consumption are represented as transitions between quiescent and growth states. We consider metabolic resource availability, growth rates, and switching rates (between states) to model a relaxation oscillator explaining transitions between these states. This frustrated bistability model reveals a required communication between the metabolic resource that determines oscillations and the quiescent and growth state cells. Cells in each state reflect memory, or hysteresis of their current state, and ``push\textendash pull'' cells from the other state. Finally, a parsimonious argument is made for a specific central metabolite as the controller of switching between quiescence and growth states. We discuss how an oscillator built around the availability of such a metabolic resource is sufficient to generally regulate oscillations between growth and quiescence through committed transitions.},

While imaging can be automated to generate very large volumes of data, the processing of the resulting movies to extract high-quality single-cell information remains a challenging task. The development of software tools that automatically identify and track cells is essential for realizing the full potential of time-lapse microscopy data. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are ideally suited for such applications, but require great amounts of manually annotated data for training, a time-consuming and tedious process.We developed a new approach to CNN training for yeast cell segmentation based on synthetic data, and present i) a software tool for the generation of synthetic images mimicking brightfield images of budding yeast cells and ii) a convolutional neural network (Mask-RCNN) for yeast segmentation that was trained on a fully synthetic dataset. The Mask-RCNN performed excellently on segmenting actual microscopy images of budding yeast cells, and a density-based clustering algorithm (DBSCAN) was able to track the detected cells across the frames of microscopy movies. Our synthetic data creation tool completely bypassed the laborious generation of manually annotated training datasets, and can be easily adjusted to produce images with many different features. The incorporation of synthetic data creation into the development pipeline of CNN-based tools for budding yeast microscopy is a critical step towards the generation of more powerful, widely applicable and user-friendly image processing tools for this microorganism.The synthetic data generation code can be found at https://github.com/prhbrt/synthetic-yeast-cells. The Mask R-CNN, as well as the tuning and benchmarking scripts can be found at https://github.com/ymzayek/yeastcells-detection-maskrcnn We also provide Google Colab scripts that reproduce all the results of this work.Supplementary material is available at Bioinformatics online.},

Phospho-Tgl4-catalyzed lipolysis contributes to early bud formation in late G1 phase of the cell cycle. Conversely, lack of lipolysis delays bud formation and cell-cycle progression. In the absence of {$\beta$}-oxidation, lipolysis-derived metabolites are thus required to support cellular growth.

In yeast, the robust autophagy response to starvation is controlled by the upregulation of ATG genes, via regulatory processes involving multiple levels of gene expression. Despite the identification of several regulators through genetic studies, the predominant mechanism of regulation modulating the autophagy response to subtle differences in nutrient status remains undefined. Here, we report the unexpected finding that subtle changes in nutrient availability can cause large differences in autophagy flux, governed by hitherto unknown post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms affecting the expression of the key autophagyinducing kinase Atg1 (ULK1/ULK2 in mammals). We have identified two novel post-transcriptional regulators of ATG1 expression, the kinase Rad53 and the RNA-binding protein Ded1 (DDX3 in mammals). Furthermore, we show that DDX3 regulates ULK1 expression post-transcriptionally, establishing mechanistic conservation and highlighting the power of yeast biology in uncovering regulatory mechanisms that can inform therapeutic approaches.},

We used these data to model translation efficiencies and found that they vary more than 400-fold between genes. Non-linear regression analysis detected that mRNA abundance and translation elongation were the dominant factors controlling protein synthesis, explaining 61\% and 15\% of its variance. Metabolic flux balance analysis further showed that only mitochondrial fluxes were positively associated with changes at the transcript level. The present dataset represents a crucial expansion to the current resources for future studies on yeast physiology.},

  abstract = {Many genes have nycthemeral rhythms of expression, i.e. a 24-hours periodic variation, at either mRNA or protein level or both, and most rhythmic genes are tissue-specific. Here, we investigate and discuss the evolutionary origins of rhythms in gene expression. Our results suggest that rhythmicity of protein expression could have been favored by selection to minimize costs. Trends are consistent in bacteria, plants and animals, and are also supported by tissue-specific patterns in mouse. Unlike for protein level, cost cannot explain rhythm at the RNA level. We suggest that instead it allows to periodically reduce expression noise. Noise control had the strongest support in mouse, with limited evidence in other species. We have also found that genes under stronger purifying selection are rhythmically expressed at the mRNA level, and we propose that this is because they are noise sensitive genes. Finally, the adaptive role of rhythmic expression is supported by rhythmic genes being highly expressed yet tissue-specific. This provides a good evolutionary explanation for the observation that nycthemeral rhythms are often tissue-specific.},

To unravel the regulation of this network upon glucose perturbation, several metabolic models have been developed for the microorganism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These dynamic representations have focused on glycolysis and answered multiple research questions, but no commonly applicable model has been presented. This review systematically evaluates the literature to describe the current advances, limitations, and opportunities. Different kinetic models have unraveled key kinetic glycolytic mechanisms. Nevertheless, some uncertainties regarding model topology and parameter values still limit the application to specific cases. Progressive improvements in experimental measurement technologies as well as advances in computational tools create new opportunities to further extend the model scale. Notably, models need to be made more complex to consider the multiple layers of glycolytic regulation and external physiological variables regulating the bioprocess, opening new possibilities for extrapolation and validation. Finally, the onset of new data representative of individual cells will cause these models to evolve from depicting an average cell in an industrial fermenter, to characterizing the heterogeneity of the population, opening new and unseen possibilities for industrial fermentation improvement.},

  abstract = {2-deoxyglucose is a glucose analog that impacts many aspects of cellular physiology. After its uptake and its phosphorylation into 2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate (2DG6P), it interferes with several metabolic pathways including glycolysis and protein N-glycosylation. Despite this systemic effect, resistance can arise through strategies that are only partially understood. In yeast, 2DG resistance is often associated with mutations causing increased activity of the yeast 5'-AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK), Snf1. Here we focus on the contribution of a Snf1 substrate in 2DG resistance, namely the alpha-arrestin Rod1 involved in nutrient transporter endocytosis. We report that 2DG triggers the endocytosis of many plasma membrane proteins, mostly in a Rod1-dependent manner. Rod1 is central to 2DG-induced endocytosis because 2DG, following its phosphorylation by hexokinase Hxk2, triggers changes in Rod1 post-translational modifications and promotes its function in endocytosis. Mechanistically, this is explained by a transient, 2DG-induced activation of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and a concomitant inactivation of Snf1/AMPK. We show that 2DG-induced endocytosis is detrimental to cells, and the lack of Rod1 counteracts this process by stabilizing glucose transporters at the plasma membrane. This facilitates glucose uptake, which may help override the metabolic blockade caused by 2DG, and 2DG export - thus terminating the process of 2DG detoxification. Altogether, these results shed a new light on the regulation of AMPK signaling in yeast and highlight a remarkable strategy to bypass 2DG toxicity involving glucose transporter regulation.},

  abstract = {Background During continuous growth in specific chemostat cultures, budding yeast undergo robust oscillations in oxygen consumption that are accompanied by highly periodic changes in transcript abundance of a majority of genes, in a phenomenon called the Yeast Metabolic Cycle (YMC). This study uses fluorescent reporters of genes specific to different YMC phases in order to visualize this phenomenon and understand the temporal regulation of gene expression at the level of individual cells within the cycling population. Methodology Fluorescent gene expression reporters for different phases of the YMC were constructed and stably integrated into the yeast genome. Subsequently, these reporter-expressing yeast were used to visualize YMC dynamics at the individual cell level in cultures grown in a chemostat or in a microfluidics platform under varying glucose concentrations, using fluorescence microscopy and quantitative Western blots. Conclusions The behavior of single cells within a metabolic cycling population was visualized using phase-specific fluorescent reporters. The reporters largely recapitulated genome-specified mRNA expression profiles. A significant fraction of the cell population appeared to exhibit basal expression of the reporters, supporting the hypothesis that there are at least two distinct subpopulations of cells within the cycling population. Although approximately half of the cycling population initiated cell division in each permissive window of the YMC, metabolic synchrony of the population was maintained. Using a microfluidics platform we observed that low glucose concentrations appear to be necessary for metabolic cycling. Lastly, we propose that there is a temporal window in the oxidative growth phase of the YMC where the cycling population segregates into at least two subpopulations, one which will enter the cell cycle and one which does not.},

This nutrient availability is closely coupled to the overall intracellular metabolic state of the cell. Therefore, cells have evolved diverse, robust and versatile modules to sense intracellular metabolic states, activate signaling outputs and regulate outcomes to these states. Yet, signaling and metabolism have been viewed as important but separate. This short review attempts to position aspects of intracellular signaling from a metabolic perspective, highlighting how conserved, core principles of metabolic sensing and signaling can emerge from an understanding of metabolic regulation. I briefly explain the nature of metabolic sensors, using the example of the AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) as an ``energy sensing'' hub. Subsequently, I explore how specific central metabolites, particularly acetyl-CoA, but also S-adenosyl methionine and SAICAR, can act as signaling molecules. I extensively illustrate the nature of a metabolic signaling hub using the specific example of the Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (TORC1), and amino acid sensing. A highlight is the emergence of the lysosome/vacuole as a metabolic and signaling hub. Finally, the need to expand our understanding of the intracellular dynamics (in concentration and localization) of several metabolites, and their signaling hubs is emphasized.},

In this work, we introduce an approach to neuronal spike train data mining which enables effective classification and clustering of neuron types and network activity states based on single-cell spiking patterns. This approach is centered around applying state-of-the-art time series classification/clustering methods to sequences of interspike intervals recorded from single neurons. We demonstrate good performance of these methods in tasks involving classification of neuron type (e.g. excitatory vs. inhibitory cells) and/or neural circuit activity state (e.g. awake vs. REM sleep vs. nonREM sleep states) on an open-access cortical spiking activity dataset.},

The productive lifetime of a bioreactor with engineered microbes is therefore susceptible to the rise of nonproductive mutants with better fitness. Synthetic addiction is emerging as a concept to artificially couple the growth rate of the microbe to production to tackle this problem. However, only a few successful cases of synthetic addiction systems have been reported to date. To understand the limitations and design constraints in long-term cultivations, we designed and studied conditional synthetic addiction circuits in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This allowed us to probe a range of selective pressure strengths and identify the optimal balance between circuit stability and production-to-growth coupling. In the optimal balance, the productive lifetime was greatly extended compared with suboptimal circuit tuning. With a too-high or -low pressure, we found that production declines mainly through homologous recombination. These principles of trade-off in the design of synthetic addition systems should lead to the better control of bioprocess performance.},

Accurately measuring the precision of noisy oscillators and the heterogeneity in period and strength of rhythmicity across a population of cells requires single-cell recordings of sufficient length to fully represent the variability of oscillations. We found persistent, independent circadian oscillations of clock gene expression in 6-week-long bioluminescence recordings of 80 primary fibroblast cells dissociated from PER2::LUC mice and kept in vitro for 6 months. Due to the stochastic nature of rhythmicity, the proportion of cells appearing rhythmic increases with the length of interval examined, with 100\% of cells found to be rhythmic when using 3-week windows. Mean period and amplitude are remarkably stable throughout the 6-week recordings, with precision improving over time. For individual cells, precision of period and amplitude are correlated with cell size and rhythm amplitude, but not with period, and period exhibits much less cycle-to-cycle variability (CV 7.3\%) than does amplitude (CV 37\%). The time series are long enough to distinguish stochastic fluctuations within each cell from differences among cells, and we conclude that the cells do exhibit significant heterogeneity in period and strength of rhythmicity, which we measure using a novel statistical metric. Furthermore, stochastic modeling suggests that these single-cell clocks operate near a Hopf bifurcation, such that intrinsic noise enhances the oscillations by minimizing period variability and sustaining amplitude.},

Accumulating evidence suggests an integrated regulation of these organelles and the nuclear cell cycle in distinct organisms. In budding yeast, a well-established example of this coregulation is the coordinated movement and positional control of mitochondria during the different phases of the cell cycle. The molecular determinants involved in the inheritance of the fittest mitochondria by the bud also seem to be cell cycle-regulated. In turn, loss of mtDNA or defects in mitochondrial structure or inheritance often lead to a cell cycle delay or arrest, indicating that mitochondrial function can also regulate cell cycle progression, possibly through the activation of cell cycle checkpoints. The up-regulation of mitochondrial respiration at G2/M, presumably to fulfil energetic requirements for progression at this phase, also supports a mitochondria-cell cycle interplay. Cell cycle-linked mitochondrial regulation is accomplished at the transcription level and through post-translational modifications, predominantly protein phosphorylation. Here, we address mitochondria-cell cycle interactions in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and discuss future challenges in the field.},

Our hypothesis posits that this mechanism integrates four different processes, all of which are initiated after yeast cells cultured in a medium initially containing glucose consume it. Quiescent cells that develop in these cultures can be separated into the high- and low-density sub-populations of different buoyant densities. Process 1 of the proposed mechanism consists of a cell-cycle arrest in the G1 phase and leads to the formation of high-density quiescent cells. Process 2 results in converting high-density quiescent cells into low-density quiescent cells. Processes 3 and 4 cause a fast or slow decline in the quiescence of low- or high-density quiescent cells, respectively. Here, we tested our hypothesis by assessing how four different geroprotectors influence the four processes that could link cellular aging to cellular quiescence. We found that these geroprotectors differently affect processes 1 and 2 and decelerate processes 3 and 4. We also found that a rise in trehalose within quiescent yeast contributes to chronological aging and quiescence maintenance. These data collectively provide conclusive evidence for a mechanistic link between cellular aging and cellular quiescence.},

  abstract = {Cryptococcus neoformans (Cn) is an important human pathogen and a model system for basidiomycetes. Here we carry out a dissection of its spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), focusing on Bub1 and Bub3. In many eukaryotes, including humans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Bub1 underwent gene duplication, generating paralogues referred to as Bub1 and BubR1 (or Mad3). Bub1 has upstream signalling functions at kinetochores, whilst BubR1/Mad3 is a component of the downstream mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) that delays anaphase onset until all chromosomes are correctly attached. Here we demonstrate that the single CnBub1 protein carries out all the checkpoint roles of both Bub1 kinase and Mad3/BubR1. Proteomic analysis reveals kinetochore targeting via Spc105KNL1 and interactions with all downstream SAC components and effectors (Cdc20 and the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome). We demonstrate that CnBub1 kinase activity is required to maintain prolonged checkpoint arrest. Thus CnBub1 acts as a SAC signalling hub and is a future target for anti-mitotic drugs.},

Previously, we mapped age-related changes in the proteome and transcriptome (Janssens et al., 2015). Here, employing the same experimental procedure and model-based inference, we generate a comprehensive account of metabolic changes during the replicative life of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. With age, we found decreasing metabolite levels, decreasing growth and substrate uptake rates accompanied by a switch from aerobic fermentation to respiration, with glycerol and acetate production. The identified metabolic fluxes revealed an increase in redox cofactor turnover, likely to combat increased production of reactive oxygen species. The metabolic changes are possibly a result of the age-associated decrease in surface area per cell volume. With metabolism being an important factor of the cellular phenotype, this work complements our recent mapping of the transcriptomic and proteomic changes towards a holistic description of the cellular phenotype during aging.},

ETC mutations are associated with a wide array of human disease conditions and to aging-related phenotypes in a number of different organisms. In this study, we sought to better understand the role of the ETC in aging using a yeast model. A panel of ETC mutant strains that fail to survive starvation was used to isolate suppressor mutants that survive. These suppressors tend to fall into major nutrient sensing and signaling pathways, suggesting that the ETC is involved in proper starvation signaling to these pathways in yeast. These suppressors also partially restore ETC-associated gene expression and pH homeostasis defects, though it remains unclear whether these phenotypes directly cause the suppression or are simply effects. This work further highlights the complex cellular network connections between metabolic pathways and signaling events in the cell and their potential roles in aging and age-related diseases.},

  abstract = {Knowing intracellular metabolite concentrations is important for fundamental metabolism research as well as for biotechnology. The first steps in a quantitative metabolomics workflow, i.e., sampling, quenching, and extraction, are key to obtaining unbiased quantitative data. A qualified quenching and extraction method not only needs to rapidly terminate the in vivo biochemical reaction activities to preserve the endogenous metabolite levels but also has to fully extract all metabolites from cells. Recently, two different filtration-based sampling, quenching, and extraction methods have been proposed and used for quantitative yeast metabolomics. One method integrates the quenching and extraction into one step using a methanol-acetonitrile-water solution after a filtration step, while the other \textemdash more conventional\textemdash{} method quenches with cold methanol and extracts with boiling ethanol. In this study, we tested whether these two methods are equally well suited for quantitative metabolome analyses with yeast. Using isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) with GC-MS and LC-MS as analytical methods, in combination with precise quantification of cell volumes, we determined absolute concentrations of 63 intracellular metabolites covering amino acids, organic acids, phosphorylated sugars, and nucleotides in two S. cerevisiae strains with different physiology. By analyzing the data from samples generated with the two methods, we found that while both methods yielded essentially identical concentrations for amino and organic acids, the cold-solvent extraction yielded significantly lower concentrations for particularly phosphorylated sugars and nucleotides, presumably because of lower quenching or extraction efficiency of this method. Our results show that methanol-quenching combined with boiling-ethanol-extraction is the more accurate approach when aiming to quantify a broad range of different metabolites from yeast cells. The significant discrepancy observed between both common metabolite extraction methods demonstrates the importance of method optimization for quantitative studies in particular when working with microbes with rigid cell walls such as those found in yeast.},

To reveal a comprehensive interconnection between genome maintenance and metabolism, we analyzed the metabolomic changes upon replication stress in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae. We found that upon treatment of cells with hydroxyurea, glucose is rapidly diverted to the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). This effect is mediated by the AMP-dependent kinase, SNF1, which phosphorylates the transcription factor Mig1, thereby relieving repression of the gene encoding the rate-limiting enzyme of the PPP. Surprisingly, NADPH produced by the PPP is required for efficient recruitment of replication protein A (RPA) to single-stranded DNA, providing the signal for the activation of the Mec1/ATR?Rad53/CHK1 checkpoint signaling kinase cascade. Thus, SNF1, best known as a central energy controller, determines a fast mode of replication checkpoint activation through a redox mechanism. These findings establish that SNF1 provides a hub with direct links to cellular metabolism, redox, and surveillance of DNA replication in eukaryotes.},

These fluctuations typically have destructive consequences for proper biological dynamics and function (e.g., loss of timing and synchrony in biological oscillators). Here, we show that gene expression noise counter-intuitively accelerates the evolution of a biological oscillator and, thus, can impart a benefit to living organisms. We used computer simulations to evolve two mechanistic models of a biological oscillator at different levels of gene expression noise. We first show that gene expression noise induces oscillatory-like dynamics in regions of parameter space that cannot oscillate in the absence of noise. We then demonstrate that these noise-induced oscillations generate a fitness landscape whose gradient robustly and quickly guides evolution by mutation towards robust and self-sustaining oscillation. These results suggest that noise can help dynamical systems evolve or learn new behavior by revealing cryptic dynamic phenotypes outside the bifurcation point.},

  abstract = {Programmed aging in yeast cells Following the fate of individual yeast cells has revealed aging to be more of a programmable decision process rather than a simple accumulation of deleterious events. Li et al. combined single-cell studies and mathematical modeling to show that yeast cells showed two different forms of aging: one with less ribosomal DNA silencing, in which nucleoli were degraded, and another with less heme accumulation and hemedependent transcription, in which mitochondria were more affected. Overexpression of the lysine deacetylase Sir2, which contributes to ribosomal DNA silencing, led to a third cell-aging fate in which the average life span was extended. If other cells age in similar ways, then this study may provide new ways to consider dynamics of aging and strategies to extend the health span. Science this issue p. 325 Chromatin instability and mitochondrial decline are conserved processes that contribute to cellular aging. Although both processes have been explored individually in the context of their distinct signaling pathways, the mechanism that determines which process dominates during aging of individual cells is unknown. We show that interactions between the chromatin silencing and mitochondrial pathways lead to an epigenetic landscape of yeast replicative aging with multiple equilibrium states that represent different types of terminal states of aging. The structure of the landscape drives single-cell differentiation toward one of these states during aging, whereby the fate is determined quite early and is insensitive to intracellular noise. Guided by a quantitative model of the aging landscape, we genetically engineered a long-lived equilibrium state characterized by an extended life span. Clues to the aging process are derived from analysis of single yeast cells throughout their life span.

  abstract = {Perturbation of the gated-synchrony system in yeast with phenelzine, an antidepressant drug used in the treatment of affective disorders in humans, leads to a rapid lengthening in the period of the genome-wide transcriptional oscillation. The effect is a concerted, genome-scale change in expression that is first seen in genes maximally expressed in the late-reductive phase of the cycle, doubling the length of the reductive phase within two cycles after treatment. Clustering of genes based on their temporal patterns of expression yielded just three super clusters whose trajectories through time could then be mapped into a simple 3D figure. In contrast to transcripts in the late-reductive phase, most transcripts do not show transients in expression relative to others in their temporal cluster but change their period in a concerted fashion. Mapping the trajectories of the transcripts into low-dimensional surfaces that can be represented by simple systems of differential equations provides a readily testable model of the dynamic architecture of phenotype. In this system, period doubling may be a preferred pathway for phenotypic change. As a practical matter, low-amplitude, genome-wide oscillations, a ubiquitous but often unrecognized attribute of phenotype, could be a source of seemingly intractable biological noise in microarray studies.},

As complex biological systems cannot be understood by simply analyzing the individual components, a systems approach is often required in which a protein is represented as a component of large, interacting networks. Here, we evaluate the current state of yeast proteome analysis using isobaric tag-based sample multiplexing (TMTpro16) to profile the proteomes of 75 yeast deletion strains for which we measured the abundance of nearly 5000 proteins. Using statistical approaches, we highlighted covariance and regulation subnetworks and the enrichment of gene ontology classifications for covarying and coregulated proteins.

  abstract = {High-throughput sequencing technologies bring a large amount of data in genomic research, with complex structure and of high dimension. With the aim of extracting meaningful knowledge from a simplified representation, we develop graph-based methods for analysing high dimensional data, focusing on clustering analysis and dimensionality reduction.    We first study the problem of graph partition, which is closely connected with clustering analysis. With spectral methods, we reformulate a dynamical based multiscale graph partition framework as a max-sum vector partitioning problem. The graph nodes are embedded as vectors varying with the time of a Markov process running on the graph, which leads to multi-resolution graph partitions. Our derivation also clarifies the quantity optimised by k-means in graph partition, and establishes its connection to spectral clustering.    Clustering analysis with multiscale graph partitioning is then investigated. Different methods for estimating a graph from the vector data are compared empirically on real datasets. The advantage of using multiscale graph partitioning for clustering is illustrated with both synthetic and real data. We further propose a similarity measure for time-dependent data based on a Gaussian process model. An RNA sequencing, time course dataset is analysed as an example application.    Finally, we integrate the graph theoretical clustering and a graph-based dimensionality reduction method with Gaussian processes. We exemplify our approach through the analysis of a transcriptomic dataset of cellular reprogramming from B-cells to iPSCs. We extract a landscape that describes the reprogramming process and identify associated genes for clustering analysis. We also reconstruct another landscape from an integrated transcriptomic dataset characterising the hematopoietic differentiation process from stem cells to somatic cells. The differences between the forward and backward processes are then studied by integrating two landscapes.},

Experiment and theory now allows us to approach some of the problems of this organized complexity (and one that embraces inherent functional purpose) characterizing the phenomenon of life. In an irreducible whole, and in a not so far from equilibrium open system, for the most part it works on a low-duty cycle. We can distinguish many types of time-dependent behaviour: e.g., oscillatory, rhythmic, clock-like timekeeping (and synchronized), deterministically chaotic, and self-similar or fractal), all simultaneously proceeding on many time scales. Self-synchronized continuous cultures of yeast represent, until now, the most characterized example of in vivo elucidation of time structure. The predominantly oscillatory behavior of network components becomes evident, with spontaneously synchronized cellular respiration cycles between discrete periods of increased oxygen consumption (oxidative phase) and decreased oxygen consumption (reductive phase). This temperature-compensated ultradian `clock' provides coordination, linking temporally partitioned functions by direct feedback loops between the energetic and redox state of the cell and its growing ultrastructure. This model system represents a basic framework is proposed as a universal cellular principle whereby ultradian rhythms are the synchronizing signatures that organize the coherence of the living state. The current challenge is to devise ever increasingly powerful, but non-invasive (or minimally perturbing) techniques to investigate the living organism.},

Although its evolution has diverged for approximately 1.5 billion years from that of human cells, yeast research provides basic clues and insights into the molecular deficiencies and disorders of many human conditions: mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular division, apoptosis, diabetes, obesity, the accompaniments of old age, cancers, and ``dynamic diseases'' (neuropsychiatric conditions, e.g., many sleep disorders, depression). Dynamic maintenance of redox status and balanced energy supply and demand is crucial for optimum function and survival of yeast and of all cells. Recent advances in optoelectronics enable fast and continuous dynamic interrogation of processes in vivo.

Specifically, we postulate that Gibbs energy released in metabolic reactions is used to perform work, allowing enzymes to self-propel or to break free from supramolecular structures. This catalysis-induced enzyme movement will result in increased intracellular motion, which in turn can compromise biomolecular functions. Once the increased intracellular motion has a detrimental effect on regulatory mechanisms, this will establish a feedback mechanism on metabolic activity, and result in the observed thermodynamic limit. While this proposed explanation for the identified upper rate limit on cellular Gibbs energy dissipation rate awaits experimental validation, it offers an intriguing perspective of how metabolic activity can globally affect biomolecular functions and will hopefully spark new research.},

  abstract = {Capturing the dynamical properties of time series concisely as interpretable feature vectors can enable efficient clustering and classification for time-series applications across science and industry. Selecting an appropriate feature-based representation of time series for a given application can be achieved through systematic comparison across a comprehensive time-series feature library, such as those in the hctsa toolbox. However, this approach is computationally expensive and involves evaluating many similar features, limiting the widespread adoption of feature-based representations of time series for real-world applications. In this work, we introduce a method to infer small sets of time-series features that (i) exhibit strong classification performance across a given collection of time-series problems, and (ii) are minimally redundant. Applying our method to a set of 93 time-series classification datasets (containing over 147,000 time series) and using a filtered version of the hctsa feature library (4791 features), we introduce a set of 22 CAnonical Time-series CHaracteristics, catch22, tailored to the dynamics typically encountered in time-series data-mining tasks. This dimensionality reduction, from 4791 to 22, is associated with an approximately 1000-fold reduction in computation time and near linear scaling with time-series length, despite an average reduction in classification accuracy of just 7\%. catch22 captures a diverse and interpretable signature of time series in terms of their properties, including linear and non-linear autocorrelation, successive differences, value distributions and outliers, and fluctuation scaling properties. We provide an efficient implementation of catch22, accessible from many programming environments, that facilitates feature-based time-series analysis for scientific, industrial, financial and medical applications using a common language of interpretable time-series properties.},

Here, we model openness in coupled oscillator systems by introducing an external driving with time-varying parameters. Five systems of increasing complexity are considered: three cases of single driven oscillators followed by two cases of driven networks. We show how the time-varying parameters can enlarge the range of other parameters for which synchronous behaviour is stable. In addition, it can yield additional behaviours such as intermittent synchronisation. The stability of these systems is analysed via short- and long-time Lyapunov exponents, both analytically and numerically. The different dynamical regimes are also described via time-frequency representation. Finally, we compare the stabilising effect of deterministic non-autonomous driving to that of bounded noise. All in all, we give an overview of some effects time-varying parameters can have on synchronisation. These effects could be a key to understand how living systems maintain stability in the face of their ever-changing environment.},

However, the effects of these dynamics on cell phenotypes can be difficult to determine. Researchers have historically been limited to passive observations of natural dynamics, which can preclude studies of elusive and noisy cellular events where large amounts of data are required to reveal statistically significant effects. Here, using recent advances in the fields of machine learning and control theory, we train a deep neural network to accurately predict the response of an optogenetic system in Escherichia coli cells. We then use the network in a deep model predictive control framework to impose arbitrary and cell-specific gene expression dynamics on thousands of single cells in real time, applying the framework to generate complex time-varying patterns. We also showcase the framework's ability to link expression patterns to dynamic functional outcomes by controlling expression of the tetA antibiotic resistance gene. This study highlights how deep learning-enabled feedback control can be used to tailor distributions of gene expression dynamics with high accuracy and throughput.},

By applying this approach to 24 experimental screens consisting of nearly 400,000 images, we differentiated specific responses from more generalized ones, discovered nuance in the localization behavior of stress-responsive proteins, and formed hypotheses by clustering proteins that have similar patterns. Previous approaches aim to capture all localization changes for a single screen as accurately as possible, whereas our work aims to integrate large amounts of imaging data to find unexpected new cell biology.},

This observation together with its mechanism suggests that the intrinsically autonomous Cdc14 release cycles are locked at once-per-cell-cycle through entrainment by the Cdk oscillator in wild-type cells. This concept may have broad implications for the structure and evolution of eukaryotic cell-cycle control.},

After imaging and tracking individual bacteria for tens of consecutive generations under tightly controlled growth conditions, cells of interest are isolated and propagated for downstream analysis, free of contamination and without genetic or physiological perturbations. This platform can characterize tens of thousands of cell lineages per day, making it possible to accurately screen complex phenotypes without the need for barcoding or genetic modifications. We applied SIFT to identify a set of ultraprecise synthetic gene oscillators, with circuit variants spanning a 30-fold range of average periods. This revealed novel design principles in synthetic biology and demonstrated the power of SIFT to reliably screen diverse dynamic phenotypes.},

Dynamics in pH modulate the activity of the glycolytic enzymes, resulting in a change in glycolytic flux and ultimately cell growth. To understand how pH affects the global behavior of glycolysis and ethanol fermentation, we measured the activity of the glycolytic and fermentative enzymes in S. cerevisiae under in vivo-like conditions at different pH. We demonstrate that glycolytic enzymes exhibit differential pH dependencies, and optima, in the pH range observed during carbon source transitions. The forward reaction of GAPDH shows the highest decrease in activity, 83\%, during a simulated feast/famine regime upon glucose removal (cytosolic pH drop from 7.1 to 6.4). We complement our biochemical characterisation of the glycolytic enzymes by fitting the Vmax to the progression curves of product formation or decay over time. The fitting analysis shows that the observed changes in enzyme activities require changes in Vmax, but changes in Km cannot be excluded. Our study highlights the relevance of pH as a key player in metabolic regulation and provides a large set of quantitative data that can be explored to improve our understanding of metabolism in dynamic environments.},

  abstract = {An enduring mystery of evolutionary genomics concerns the mechanisms responsible for lineage-specific expansions of genome size in eukaryotes, especially in multicellular species. One idea is that all excess DNA is mutationally hazardous, but weakly enough so that genome-size expansion passively emerges in species experiencing relatively low efficiency of selection owing to small effective population sizes. Another idea is that substantial gene additions were impossible without the energetic boost provided by the colonizing mitochondrion in the eukaryotic lineage. Contrary to this latter view, analysis of cellular energetics and genomics data from a wide variety of species indicates that, relative to the lifetime ATP requirements of a cell, the costs of a gene at the DNA, RNA, and protein levels decline with cell volume in both bacteria and eukaryotes. Moreover, these costs are usually sufficiently large to be perceived by natural selection in bacterial populations, but not in eukaryotes experiencing high levels of random genetic drift. Thus, for scaling reasons that are not yet understood, by virtue of their large size alone, eukaryotic cells are subject to a broader set of opportunities for the colonization of novel genes manifesting weakly advantageous or even transiently disadvantageous phenotypic effects. These results indicate that the origin of the mitochondrion was not a prerequisite for genome-size expansion.},

For two decades, this framework has been used for rational design of microbial cell factories. In the last decade, the range of applications has exploded, and new frontiers have emerged, including the study of the gut microbiome and its health implications, and the role of microbial communities in global ecosystems. However, all the critical steps in this framework, from model construction to simulation, require the use of powerful linear optimization solvers, with the choice often relying on commercial solvers for their well-known computational efficiency. In this work, I benchmark a total of six solvers (two commercial and four open-source) and measure their performance to solve linear and mixed-integer linear problems of increasing complexity. Although commercial solvers are still the fastest, at least two open-source solvers show comparable performance. These results show that genome-scale metabolic modeling does not need to be hindered by commercial licensing schemes and can become a truly open science framework for solving urgent societal challenges.},

Basal promoters dependent on the elements for upstream activating sequence activity are inactive in {$\Delta$}swi6 yeast. Yeast were screened for mutations that activated MCB reporter genes in the absence of Swi6. The mutations identified a single complementation group. Functional cloning revealed the mutations were alleles of theTRR1 gene encoding thioredoxin reductase. Although deletion of TRR1 activated MCB reporter genes, high copy expression did not suppress reporter gene activity. The trr1 mutations strongly (20-fold) stimulated MCB- and SCB (Swi4/Swi6 cell cycle box)-containing reporter genes, but also weakly (3-fold) stimulated reporter genes that lacked these elements. The trr1mutations did not affect the level or periodicity of three endogenous MCB gene mRNAs (TMP1, RNR1, andSWI4). Deletion of thioredoxin genes TRX1 andTRX2 recapitulated the stimulatory effect oftrr1 mutations on MCB reporter gene activity. Conditions expected to oxidize thioredoxin (exposure to H2O2) induced MCB gene expression, whereas conditions expected to conserve thioredoxin (exposure to hydroxyurea) inhibited MCB gene expression. The results suggest that thioredoxin oxidation contributes to MCB element activation and suggest a link between thioredoxin-oxidizing processes such as ribonucleotide reduction and cell cycle-specific gene transcription.},

The role of flavin, however, is not limited to redox processes, as {$\sim$} 10\% of flavin-dependent enzymes catalyze nonredox reactions. Moreover, the flavin cofactor is also widely used as a signaling and sensing molecule in biological processes such as phototropism and nitrogen fixation. Here, we present a study of 374 flavin-dependent proteins analyzed with regard to their function, structure and distribution among 22 archaeal, eubacterial, protozoan and eukaryotic genomes. More than 90\% of flavin-dependent enzymes are oxidoreductases, and the remaining enzymes are classified as transferases (4.3\%), lyases (2.9\%), isomerases (1.4\%) and ligases (0.4\%). The majority of enzymes utilize FAD (75\%) rather than FMN (25\%), and bind the cofactor noncovalently (90\%). High-resolution structures are available for about half of the flavoproteins. FAD-containing proteins predominantly bind the cofactor in a Rossmann fold ({$\sim$} 50\%), whereas FMN-containing proteins preferably adopt a ({$\beta\alpha$})8-(TIM)-barrel-like or flavodoxin-like fold. The number of genes encoding flavin-dependent proteins varies greatly in the genomes analyzed, and covers a range from {$\sim$} 0.1\% to 3.5\% of the predicted genes. It appears that some species depend heavily on flavin-dependent oxidoreductases for degradation or biosynthesis, whereas others have minimized their flavoprotein arsenal. An understanding of `flavin-intensive' lifestyles, such as in the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis, may result in valuable new intervention strategies that target either riboflavin biosynthesis or uptake.},

  abstract = {When grown in continuous culture, budding yeast cells tend to synchronize their respiratory activity to form a stable oscillation that percolates throughout cellular physiology and involves the majority of the protein-coding transcriptome. Oscillations in batch culture and at single cell level support the idea that these dynamics constitute a general growth principle. The precise molecular mechanisms and biological functions of the oscillation remain elusive. Fourier analysis of transcriptome time series datasets from two different oscillation periods (0.7 h and 5 h) reveals seven distinct co-expression clusters common to both systems (34\% of all yeast ORF), which consolidate into two superclusters when correlated with a compilation of 1,327 unrelated transcriptome datasets. These superclusters encode for cell growth and anabolism during the phase of high, and mitochondrial growth, catabolism and stress response during the phase of low oxygen uptake. The promoters of each cluster are characterized by different nucleotide contents, promoter nucleosome configurations, and dependence on ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling complexes. We show that the ATP:ADP ratio oscillates, compatible with alternating metabolic activity of the two superclusters and differential feedback on their transcription via activating (RSC) and repressive (Isw2) types of promoter structure remodeling. We propose a novel feedback mechanism, where the energetic state of the cell, reflected in the ATP:ADP ratio, gates the transcription of large, but functionally coherent groups of genes via differential effects of ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling machineries. Besides providing a mechanistic hypothesis for the delayed negative feedback that results in the oscillatory phenotype, this mechanism may underpin the continuous adaptation of growth to environmental conditions.},

  abstract = {Cancer-related metabolic features are in part maintained by hexokinase 2 upregulation, which leads to high levels of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) and is needed to provide energy and biomass to support rapid proliferation. Using a humanized model of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we explored how human hexokinase 2 (HK2) behaves under different nutritional conditions. At high glucose levels, yeast presents aerobic glycolysis through a regulatory mechanism known as catabolic repression, which exerts a metabolic adaptation like the Warburg effect. At high glucose concentrations, HK2 did not translocate into the nucleus and was not able to shift the metabolism toward a highly glycolytic state, in contrast to the effect of yeast hexokinase 2 (Hxk2), which is a crucial protein for the control of aerobic glycolysis in S. cerevisiae. During the stationary phase, when glucose is exhausted, Hxk2 is shuttled out of the nucleus, ceasing catabolic repression. Cells harvested at this condition display low glucose consumption rates. However, glucose-starved cells expressing HK2 had an increased capacity to consume glucose. In those cells, HK2 localized to mitochondria, becoming insensitive to G6P inhibition. We also found that the sugar trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P) is a human HK2 inhibitor, like yeast Hxk2, but was not able to inhibit human HK1, the isoform that is ubiquitously expressed in almost all mammalian tissues. In contrast to G6P, T6P inhibited HK2 even when HK2 was associated with mitochondria. The binding of HK2 to mitochondria is crucial for cancer survival and proliferation. T6P was able to reduce the cell viability of tumor cells, although its toxicity was not impressive. This was expected as cell absorption of phosphorylated sugars is low, which might be counteracted using nanotechnology. Altogether, these data suggest that T6P may offer a new paradigm for cancer treatment based on specific inhibition of HK2.},

In this review, the molecular methods and toolkits developed for S. cerevisiae are discussed in terms of their contributions to the required standardization efforts. In addition, the toolkits designed for emerging nonconventional yeast species including Yarrowia lipolytica, Komagataella phaffii, and Kluyveromyces marxianus are also reviewed. Without a doubt, the characterized DNA parts combined with the standardized assembly strategies highlighted in these toolkits have greatly contributed to the rapid development of many metabolic engineering and diagnostics applications among others.

Not all yeasts exhibit the Crabtree effect, and it is not known why Crabtree-negative yeasts can grow at rates comparable to Crabtree-positive yeasts. Here, we quantitatively compared two Crabtree-positive yeasts, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and two Crabtree-negative yeasts, Kluyveromyces marxianus and Scheffersomyces stipitis, cultivated under glucose excess conditions. Combining physiological and proteome quantification with genome-scale metabolic modeling, we found that the two groups differ in energy metabolism and translation efficiency. In Crabtree-positive yeasts, the central carbon metabolism flux and proteome allocation favor a glucose utilization strategy minimizing proteome cost as proteins translation parameters, including ribosomal content and/or efficiency, are lower. Crabtree-negative yeasts, however, use a strategy of maximizing ATP yield, accompanied by higher protein translation parameters. Our analyses provide insight into the underlying reasons for the Crabtree effect, demonstrating a coupling to adaptations in both metabolism and protein translation.},

  urldate = {2023-07-05},
  abstract = {Ribosomes are the machines that produce proteins in the cell. They are, with histones, the most expressed proteins, accounting together for almost half of the total gene expression. Ribosome number varies with growth rate, the energy state of the cell, and with the cell cycle.    Bacterial cells express more ribosomes the higher their growth rate; the number will also increase when there is an inhibitor of translation present. In contrast to ribosomal genes, constitutive genes show a decrease in expression with growth rate, as cells prioritize ribosome and histone genes.    Although these results are well established in bacteria, they are much less so in eukaryotic cells. The aim of this thesis was to determine if the eukaryote budding yeast behaved similarly to Escherichia coli and obeyed the same phenomenological relationships.    First, a reliable way to modulate growth rate without the use of drugs is by changing the concentration of carbon source, but yeast grows slowly only in prohibitively low concentrations of glucose, the typical carbon source. Raffinose is a poorly fermented trisaccharide. Here I show that it follows a gentle Monod curve, increasing growth rate steadily with the increase in concentration and plateauing only at high concentrations. I argue that it is the sugar of choice for tuning the growth rate in yeast.    Second, I explore orthogonal induction systems in yeast with the goal of causing competition for translational resources. I conclude that the inducer doxycycline is deleterious in respiring yeast likely because of adverse effects on the mitochondria.    Third, I wanted to determine the behaviour of constitutively expressed genes as a function of growth rate as a benchmark for the measurement of ribosomal expression. Using a set of reported constitutive promoters controlling the expression of fluorescent proteins, cells were grown at different rates to measure expression at the point of maximal growth rate. I conclude that constitutive expression typically shows a moderate decrease in expression at higher growth rates.    Fourth, I developed a new, straightforward protocol to estimate the concentration of ribosomes. I used a series of strains with GFP ribosomal tags in plate readers to estimate ribosomal expression and demonstrated that the fluorescence was directly correlated with growth rate, following quantitatively the relationship obtained by others using mass spectrometry. My results show that ribosomes can be quantified simply, avoiding biochemical extractions and allowing real-time measurements.    Fifth, to determine the interrelationships between translation-poisoning drugs, ribosomal concentrations, and growth rate in yeast, I selected a strain with the RPL3 tag and exposed cells to different concentrations of cycloheximide and raffinose. I proved that the concentrations of ribosomes had the same behaviours as a function of growth rate as E. coli does to chloramphenicol: the correlation between ribosomes and maximal growth rate increases steepness at higher drug dosages. A further observation was that plotting time-series data, there is an almost linear decrease in fluorescence with growth rate after the point of maximal fluorescence that follows closely the ribosome to growth relationship at maximal growth rate. It may suggest that cells maintain the maximal possible number of ribosomes during the deceleration phase of the growth curve.     Finally, some translation-poisoning antibiotics are more effective on slow growing bacteria and others are more effective on fast growing bacteria. This behaviour is a result of the dependence of growth rate on ribosomes and, given my results, it should hold too in yeast. I developed and quantitively compared different ways to characterise cellular growth with the aim of finding the best method to compare the effects of drugs at different growth rates. I then demonstrated that for yeast too the efficacy of some drugs increases with growth rate and that of others decreases.  In summary, I show that bacterial growth laws extend to eukaryotic cells and that, like E. coli, budding yeast is constrained in how it allocates intracellular resources to synthesise proteins.},

However, the lack of other constraints in the stoichiometric model often leads to a large metabolic solution space inaccessible. Inspired by previous studies that take allocation of macromolecule resources into account, we developed a simplified Python-based workflow for constructing enzymatic constrained metabolic network model (ECMpy) and constructed an enzyme-constrained model for Escherichia coli (eciML1515) by directly adding a total enzyme amount constraint in the latest version of GEM for E. coli (iML1515), considering the protein subunit composition in the reaction, and automated calibration of enzyme kinetic parameters. Using eciML1515, we predicted the overflow metabolism of E. coli and revealed that redox balance was the key reason for the difference between E. coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae in overflow metabolism. The growth rate predictions on 24 single-carbon sources were improved significantly when compared with other enzyme-constrained models of E. coli. Finally, we revealed the tradeoff between enzyme usage efficiency and biomass yield by exploring the metabolic behaviors under different substrate consumption rates. Enzyme-constrained models can improve simulation accuracy and thus can predict cellular phenotypes under various genetic perturbations more precisely, providing reliable guidance for metabolic engineering.},

  abstract = {How cells maintain their size has been extensively studied under constant conditions. In the wild, however, cells rarely experience constant environments. Here, we examine how the 24-h circadian clock and environmental cycles modulate cell size control and division timings in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus using single-cell time-lapse microscopy. Under constant light, wild-type cells follow an apparent sizer-like principle. Closer inspection reveals that the clock generates two subpopulations, with cells born in the subjective day following different division rules from cells born in subjective night. A stochastic model explains how this behavior emerges from the interaction of cell size control with the clock. We demonstrate that the clock continuously modulates the probability of cell division throughout day and night, rather than solely applying an on-off gate to division, as previously proposed. Iterating between modeling and experiments, we go on to identify an effective coupling of the division rate to time of day through the combined effects of the environment and the clock on cell division. Under naturally graded light-dark cycles, this coupling narrows the time window of cell divisions and shifts divisions away from when light levels are low and cell growth is reduced. Our analysis allows us to disentangle, and predict the effects of, the complex interactions between the environment, clock, and cell size control.},

The cornea is an avascular, thick (400 {$\mu$}m), semitransparent, living optical element in the front region of the eye. The corneal epithelium and endothelium comprise the limiting cell layers on the anterior and posterior surfaces of the cornea. An optical technique for two-dimensional metabolic imaging of cellular metabolism in cellular layers of the cornea is described in the chapter. These methods are also suitable for other cells and tissues and provide a general noninvasive optical method to monitor cellular function. Two-dimensional redox imaging of NAD(P)H and flavoprotein fluorescence intensity is a measure of cellular metabolism and provides a noninvasive optical method to study cell metabolism. The combination of confocal microscopy, with its excellent optical sectioning capabilities, and the optical imaging of cell metabolism provides a useful technique for cell biology.},

To systematically assess cell-to-cell phenotypic variability, we combined automated yeast genetics, high-content screening and neural network-based image analysis of single cells, focussing on genes that influence the architecture of four subcellular compartments of the endocytic pathway as a model system. Our unbiased assessment of the morphology of these compartments?endocytic patch, actin patch, late endosome and vacuole?identified 17 distinct mutant phenotypes associated with \textasciitilde 1,600 genes (\textasciitilde 30\% of all yeast genes). Approximately half of these mutants exhibited multiple phenotypes, highlighting the extent of morphological pleiotropy. Quantitative analysis also revealed that incomplete penetrance was prevalent, with the majority of mutants exhibiting substantial variability in phenotype at the single-cell level. Our single-cell analysis enabled exploration of factors that contribute to incomplete penetrance and cellular heterogeneity, including replicative age, organelle inheritance and response to stress.},

However, how these changes arise and whether they contribute themselves to ageing is poorly understood. We show that SAGA-dependent attachment of DNA circles to NPCs in replicatively ageing yeast cells causes NPCs to lose their nuclear basket and cytoplasmic complexes. These NPCs were not recognized as defective by the NPC quality control machinery (SINC) and not targeted by ESCRTs. They interacted normally or more effectively with protein import and export factors but specifically lost mRNA export factors. Acetylation of Nup60 drove the displacement of basket and cytoplasmic complexes from circle-bound NPCs. Mutations preventing this remodeling extended the replicative lifespan of the cells. Thus, our data suggest that the anchorage of accumulating circles locks NPCs in a specialized state and that this process is intrinsically linked to the mechanisms by which ERCs promote ageing.},

For now, A few studies were proposed in transcriptome and proteome analysis to discover the heterogeneity among single cells. However, microbial single cell metabolomics has not been possible yet. Herein, we developed a method, RespectM, based on discontinuous mass spectrometry imaging, which can detect more than 700 metabolites at a rate of 500 cells per hour. While ensuring the high throughput of RespectM, it integrates matrix sublimation, QC-based peak filtering, and batch correction strategies to improve accuracy. The results show that RespectM can distinguish single microbial cells from the blank matrix with an accuracy of 98.4\%, depending on classification algorithms. Furthermore, to verify the accuracy of RespectM for distinguishing different single cells, we performed a classification test on Chlamydomonas reinhardtii single cells among allelic strains. The results showed an accuracy of 93.1\%, which provides RespectM with enough confidence to perform microbial single cell metabolomics analysis. As we expected, untreated microbial cells will spontaneously undergo metabolic grouping coherence with genetic and biochemical similarities. Interestingly, the pseudo-time analysis also provided intuitive evidence on the metabolic dimension, indicating the cell grouping is based on microbial population heterogeneity. We believe that the RespectM can offer a powerful tool in the microbial study. Researchers can now directly analyze the changes in microbial metabolism at a single-cell level with high efficiency.},

The YMC is a unique system that combines respiratory bursts with oscillations in both transcript levels and hundreds of metabolites in a tightly-controlled manner, creating an effective single-cell behavior that can be studied using sequencing techniques that require large quantities of cells.

In particular, our model explains the shape of the dissolved oxygen trace observed in the chemostat, replicates the spontaneous yeast synchronization obtained after a glucose starvation phase, and predicts the effect that carbon-source perturbations will have on the YMC.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Computational optimization can effectively aid the design process, but current methods are generally unsuited for systems with multiple temporal or concentration scales, as these are slow to simulate due to their numerical stiffness. Here, we present a machine learning method for the efficient optimization of biological circuits across scales. The method relies on Bayesian optimization, a technique commonly used to fine-tune deep neural networks, to learn the shape of a performance landscape and iteratively navigate the design space toward an optimal circuit. This strategy allows the joint optimization of both circuit architecture and parameters, and provides a feasible approach to solve a highly nonconvex optimization problem in a mixed-integer input space. We illustrate the applicability of the method on several gene circuits for controlling biosynthetic pathways with strong nonlinearities, multiple interacting scales, and using various performance objectives. The method efficiently handles large multiscale problems and enables parametric sweeps to assess circuit robustness to perturbations, serving as an efficient in silico screening method prior to experimental implementation.},

Here, we demonstrate that combining functional genomics with proteomics uncovers general principles of protein expression, and provides new avenues to annotate protein function. We recorded precise proteomes for all non-essential gene knock-outs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We find that protein abundance is driven by a complex interplay of i) general biological properties, including translation rate, turnover, and copy number variations, and ii) their genetic, metabolic and physical interactions, including membership in protein complexes. We further show that combining genetic perturbation with proteomics provides complementary dimensions of functional annotation: proteomic profiling, reverse proteomic profiling, profile similarity and protein covariation analysis. Thus, our study generates a resource in which nine million protein quantities are linked to 79\% of the yeast coding genome, and shows that functional proteomics reveals principles that govern protein expression. Highlights- Nine million protein quantities recorded in \textasciitilde 4,600 non-essential gene deletions in S. cerevisiae reveal principles of how the proteome responds to genetic perturbation- Genome-scale protein expression is determined by both functional relationships between proteins, as well as common biological responses- Broad protein expression profiles in slow-growing strains can be explained by chromosomal aneuploidies- Protein half-life and ribosome occupancy are predictable from protein abundance changes across knock-outs- Functional proteomics annotates missing gene function in four complementary dimensions},

Ribosomes drive cell growth, but translation of ribosomal proteins competes with production of non-ribosomal proteins. Theory shows that cell growth is maximized when all expressed ribosomes are constantly translating. To examine whether budding yeast function at this limit of full ribosomal usage, we profiled the proteomes of cells growing in different environments. We find that cells produce excess ribosomal proteins, amounting to a constant {$\approx$}8\% of the proteome. Accordingly, {$\approx$}25\% of ribosomal proteins expressed in rapidly growing cells does not contribute to translation. Further, this fraction increases as growth rate decreases and these excess ribosomal proteins are employed when translation demands unexpectedly increase. We suggest that steadily growing cells prepare for conditions that demand increased translation by producing excess ribosomes, at the expense of lower steady-state growth rate.},

Assessing the state of the art, we show that, currently, in-depth analyses of model performance are often absent and must be improved. This review provides a toolbox for the analysis of model robustness and performance, and simultaneously proposes a standard for the community to facilitate future work. It is further accompanied by an interactive online tutorial on the discussed issues.},

  abstract = {Time series classification (TSC) is home to a number of algorithm groups that utilise different kinds of discriminatory patterns. One of these groups describes classifiers that predict using phase dependant intervals. The time series forest (TSF) classifier is one of the most well known interval methods, and has demonstrated strong performance as well as relative speed in training and predictions. However, recent advances in other approaches have left TSF behind. TSF originally summarises intervals using three simple summary statistics. The `catch22' feature set of 22 time series features was recently proposed to aid time series analysis through a concise set of diverse and informative descriptive characteristics. We propose combining TSF and catch22 to form a new classifier, the Canonical Interval Forest (CIF). We outline additional enhancements to the training procedure, and extend the classifier to include multivariate classification capabilities. We demonstrate a large and significant improvement in accuracy over both TSF and catch22, and show it to be on par with top performers from other algorithmic classes. By upgrading the interval-based component from TSF to CIF, we also demonstrate a significant improvement in the hierarchical vote collective of transformation-based ensembles (HIVE-COTE) that combines different time series representations. HIVE-COTE using CIF is significantly more accurate on the UCR archive than any other classifier we are aware of and represents a new state of the art for TSC.},

Structural biology has historically taken the reductionist approach to deeply probe the inner workings of complex molecular machines. In contrast, systems biology and genome-scale modeling have organically grown out of the wealth of data now being generated by diverse omics measurements. In the late 2000s, a proposed interdisciplinary field of structural systems biology pitched the merger of these two approaches, with widespread applications in pharmacology, disease modeling, protein engineering, and evolutionary studies. In this commentary, we highlight the challenges of integrating these two fields, with a focus on genome-scale metabolic modeling, and the novel findings that are made possible from such a merger.},

  abstract = {Background Isotope labeling experiments (ILEs) are increasingly used to investigate the functioning of metabolic systems. Some enzymes are subject to kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) which modulate reaction rates depending on the isotopic composition of their substrate(s). KIEs may therefore affect both the propagation of isotopes through metabolic networks and their operation, and ultimately jeopardize the biological value of ILEs. However, the actual impact of KIEs on metabolism has never been investigated at the system level. Results First, we developed a framework which integrates KIEs into kinetic and isotopic models of metabolism, thereby accounting for their system-wide effects on metabolite concentrations, metabolic fluxes, and isotopic patterns. Then, we applied this framework to assess the impact of KIEs on the central carbon metabolism of Escherichia coli in the context of 13C-ILEs, under different situations commonly encountered in laboratories. Results showed that the impact of KIEs strongly depends on the label input and on the variable considered but is significantly lower than expected intuitively from measurements on isolated enzymes. The global robustness of both the metabolic operation and isotopic patterns largely emerge from intrinsic properties of metabolic networks, such as the distribution of control across the network and bidirectional isotope exchange. Conclusions These results demonstrate the necessity of investigating the impact of KIEs at the level of the entire system, contradict previous hypotheses that KIEs would have a strong effect on isotopic distributions and on flux determination, and strengthen the biological value of 13C-ILEs. The proposed modeling framework is generic and can be used to investigate the impact of all the isotopic tracers (2H, 13C, 15N, 18O, etc.) on different isotopic datasets and metabolic systems. By allowing the integration of isotopic and metabolomics data collected under stationary and/or non-stationary conditions, it may also assist interpretations of ILEs and facilitate the development of more accurate kinetic models with improved explicative and predictive capabilities.

  abstract = {The metabolism of microorganisms is regulated through two main mechanisms: changes of enzyme capacities as a consequence of gene expression modulation (``hierarchical control'') and changes of enzyme activities through metabolite-enzyme interactions. An increasing body of evidence indicates that hierarchical control is insufficient to explain metabolic behaviors, but the system-wide impact of metabolic regulation remains largely uncharacterized. To clarify its role, we developed and validated a detailed kinetic model of Escherichia coli central metabolism that links growth to environment. Metabolic control analyses confirm that the control is widely distributed across the network and highlight strong interconnections between all the pathways. Exploration of the model solution space reveals that several robust properties emerge from metabolic regulation, from the molecular level (e.g. homeostasis of total metabolite pool) to the overall cellular physiology (e.g. coordination of carbon uptake, catabolism, energy and redox production, and growth), while allowing a large degree of flexibility at most individual metabolic steps. These properties have important physiological implications for E. coli and significantly expand the self-regulating capacities of its metabolism.},

(2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 13984\textendash 13988). This was based on compensation by overexpression of Ald6p for phenotypes associated with ZWF1 gene disruption and on the apparent lethality resulting from co-disruption of ZWF1 and ALD6 genes. However, we have found that a zwf1{$\Delta$}ald6{$\Delta$} mutant can be constructed by mating when tetrads are dissected on plates with a nonfermentable carbon source (lactate), a condition associated with expression of another enzymatic source of NADPH, cytosolic NADP+-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase (Idp2p). We demonstrated previously that a zwf1{$\Delta$}idp2{$\Delta$} mutant loses viability when shifted to medium with oleate or acetate as the carbon source, apparently because of the inadequate supply of NADPH for cellular antioxidant systems. In contrast, the zwf1{$\Delta$}ald6{$\Delta$} mutant grows as well as the parental strain in similar shifts. In addition, the zwf1{$\Delta$}ald6{$\Delta$} mutant grows slowly but does not lose viability when shifted to culture medium with glucose as the carbon source, and the mutant resumes growth when the glucose is exhausted from the medium. Measurements of NADP(H) levels revealed that NADPH may not be rapidly utilized in the zwf1{$\Delta$}ald6{$\Delta$} mutant in glucose medium, perhaps because of a reduction in fatty acid synthesis associated with loss of Ald6p. In contrast, levels of NADP+ rise dramatically in the zwf1{$\Delta$}idp2{$\Delta$} mutant in acetate medium, suggesting a decrease in production of NADPH reducing equivalents needed both for biosynthesis and for antioxidant functions.},

  abstract = {Carbon limitation is a common feeding strategy in bioprocesses to enable an efficient microbiological conversion of a substrate to a product. However, industrial settings inherently promote mixing insufficiencies, creating zones of famine conditions. Cells frequently traveling through such regions repeatedly experience substrate shortages and respond individually but often with a deteriorated production performance. A priori knowledge of the expected strain performance would enable targeted strain, process, and bioreactor engineering for minimizing performance loss. Today, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) coupled to data-driven kinetic models are a promising route for the in silico investigation of the impact of the dynamic environment in the large-scale bioreactor on microbial performance. However, profound wet-lab datasets are needed to cover relevant perturbations on realistic time scales. As a pioneering study, we quantified intracellular metabolome dynamics of Saccharomyces cerevisiae following an industrially relevant famine perturbation. Stimulus-response experiments were operated as chemostats with an intermittent feed and high-frequency sampling. Our results reveal that even mild glucose gradients in the range of 100 {$\mu$}mol{$\cdot$}L-1 impose significant perturbations in adapted and non-adapted yeast cells, altering energy and redox homeostasis. Apparently, yeast sacrifices catabolic reduction charges for the sake of anabolic persistence under acute carbon starvation conditions. After repeated exposure to famine conditions, adapted cells show 2.7\% increased maintenance demands.},

However, owing to the tightly constrained and interconnected nature of lipid biosynthesis, both understanding and engineering of lipid metabolism remain challenging, even with the help of mathematical models. Here we report the development of a kinetic metabolic model of lipid metabolism in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that integrates fatty acid biosynthesis, glycerophospholipid metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, storage lipids, lumped sterol synthesis, and the synthesis and transport of relevant target-chemicals, such as fatty acids and fatty alcohols. The model was trained on lipidomic data of a reference S. cerevisiae strain, single knockout mutants, and lipid overproduction strains reported in literature. The model was used to design mutants for fatty alcohol overproduction and the lipidomic analysis of the resultant mutant strains coupled with model-guided hypothesis led to discovery of a futile cycle in the triacylglycerol biosynthesis pathway. In addition, the model was used to explain successful and unsuccessful mutant designs in metabolic engineering literature. Thus, this kinetic model of lipid metabolism can not only enable the discovery of new phenomenon in lipid metabolism but also the engineering of mutant strains for overproduction of lipids.},

  abstract = {Noise annoyance has been often reported as one of the main adverse effects of noise exposure on human health, and there is consensus that it relates to several factors going beyond the mere energy content of the signal. Research has historically focused on a limited set of sound sources (e.g., transport and industrial noise); only more recently is attention being given to more holistic aspects of urban acoustic environments and the role they play in the noise annoyance perceptual construct. This is the main approach promoted in soundscape studies, looking at both wanted and unwanted sounds. In this study, three specific aspects were investigated, namely: (1) the effect of different sound sources combinations, (2) the number of sound sources present in the soundscape, and (3) the presence of individual sound source, on noise annoyance perception. For this purpose, a large-scale online experiment was carried out with 1.2k+ participants, using 2.8k+ audio recordings of complex urban acoustic environments to investigate how they would influence the perceived noise annoyance. Results showed that: (1) the combinations of different sound sources were not important, compared, instead, to the number of sound sources identified in the soundscape recording (regardless of sound sources type); (2) the annoyance ratings expressed a minimum when any two clearly distinguishable sound sources were present in a given urban soundscape; and (3) the presence (either in isolation or combination) of traffic-related sound sources increases noise annoyance, while the presence (either in isolation or combination) of nature-related sound sources decreases noise annoyance.},

Variability between cells is often attributed to stochastic noise, although it may be generated by deterministic components. Interestingly, lineage information can be used to distinguish between variability and determinism. Analysis of correlations within a lineage of the mammalian cell cycle duration revealed its deterministic nature. Here, we discuss the sources of such variability and the possibility that the underlying deterministic process is due to the circadian clock. Finally, we discuss the ``kicked cell cycle'' model and its implication on the study of the cell cycle in healthy and cancerous tissues.},

The latter two phenomena are also observed in fast growing tumour cells and cell lines. These patterns suggest a fundamental principle of design. In biology such designs can often be understood as the result of the optimization of fitness. Here we show that in basic models of self-replicating systems these patterns are the consequence of maximizing the growth rate. Whereas most models of cellular growth consider a part of physiology, for instance only metabolism, the approach presented here integrates several subsystems to a complete self-replicating system. Such models can yield fundamentally different optimal strategies. In particular, it is shown how the shift in metabolic efficiency originates from a tradeoff between investments in enzyme synthesis and metabolic yields for alternative catabolic pathways. The models elucidate how the optimization of growth by natural selection shapes growth strategies.},

For microbes, plate readers are a popular, convenient means to measure growth and also gene expression using fluorescent reporters. Nevertheless, the difficulties of analysing the resulting data can be a bottleneck, particularly when combining measurements from different wells and plates. Here we present omniplate, a Python module that corrects and normalises plate-reader data, estimates growth rates and fluorescence per cell as functions of time, calculates errors, exports in different formats, and enables meta-analysis of multiple plates. The software corrects for autofluorescence, the optical density's non-linear dependence on the number of cells, and the effects of the media. We use omniplate to measure the Monod relationship for growth of budding yeast in raffinose, showing that raffinose is a convenient carbon source for controlling growth rates. Using fluorescent tagging, we study yeast's glucose transport. Our results are consistent with the regulation of the hexose transporter (HXT) genes being approximately bipartite: the medium and high affinity transporters are predominately regulated by both the high affinity glucose sensor Snf3 and the kinase complex SNF1 via the repressors Mth1, Mig1, and Mig2; the low affinity transporters are predominately regulated by the low affinity sensor Rgt2 via the co-repressor Std1. We thus demonstrate that omniplate is a powerful tool for exploiting the advantages offered by time-series data in revealing biological regulation.},

Using mathematical modelling, we show that transporters that use either facilitated diffusion or symport can have a rate-affinity tradeoff, where an increase in the maximal rate of transport decreases the transporter's apparent affinity. These changes affect the import flux non-monotonically, and for a given concentration of extracellular nutrient there is one transporter, characterised by its affinity, that has a higher import flux than any other. Through encoding multiple transporters, cells can therefore mitigate the tradeoff by expressing those transporters with higher affinities in lower concentrations of nutrients. We verify our predictions using fluorescent tagging of seven HXT genes in budding yeast and follow their expression over time in batch culture. Using the known affinities of the corresponding transporters, we show that their regulation in glucose is broadly consistent with a rate-affinity tradeoff: as glucose falls, the levels of the different transporters peak in an order that mostly follows their affinity for glucose. More generally, evolution is constrained by tradeoffs. Our findings indicate that one such tradeoff often occurs in the cellular transport of nutrients.},

Studying glucose transport in budding yeast, we determine mechanistically how such matching occurs for seven hexose transporters. By combining time-lapse microscopy with mathematical modelling, we find that levels of transporters are history-dependent and are regulated by a push-pull system comprising two types of repressors. Repression by these two types varies with glucose in opposite ways, and not only matches the expression of transporters by their affinity to a range of glucose concentrations, but also the expression of some to how glucose is changing. We argue that matching is favoured by a rate-affinity trade-off and that the regulatory system allows yeast to import glucose rapidly enough to starve competitors. Matching expression to a pattern of input is fundamental, and we believe that push-pull repression is widespread.},

  abstract = {We present a study of the metabolism of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis after exposure to antibiotics using proteomics data and flux balance analysis (FBA). The use of FBA to study prokaryotic organisms is well-established and allows insights into the metabolic pathways chosen by the organisms under different environmental conditions. To apply FBA a specific objective function must be selected that represents the metabolic goal of the organism. FBA estimates the metabolism of the cell by linear programming constrained by the stoichiometry of the reactions in an in silico metabolic model of the organism. It is assumed that the metabolism of the organism works towards the specified objective function. A common objective is the maximization of biomass. However, this goal is not suitable for situations when the bacterium is exposed to antibiotics, as the goal of organisms in these cases is survival and not necessarily optimal growth. In this paper we propose a new approach for defining the FBA objective function in studies when the bacterium is under stress. The function is defined based on protein expression data. The proposed methodology is applied to the case when the bacterium is exposed to the drug mefloquine, but can be easily extended to other organisms, conditions or drugs. We compare our method with an alternative method that uses experimental data for adjusting flux constraints. We perform comparisons in terms of essential enzymes and agreement using enzyme abundances. Results indicate that using proteomics data to define FBA objective functions yields less essential reactions with zero flux and lower error rates in prediction accuracy. With flux variability analysis we observe that overall variability due to alternate optima is reduced with the incorporation of proteomics data. We believe that incorporating proteomics data in the objective function used in FBA may help obtain metabolic flux representations that better support experimentally observed features.},

The detailed route by which birhythmicity develops from a single oscillatory regime is elucidated by means of bifurcation diagrams. It is shown that birhythmicity provides added sensitivity to the oscillatory system as the same type of perturbation may produce a switch from one periodic regime to the other and back, when applied at the appropriate phase of each of the two oscillations.},

To thrive in such dynamic habitats, microorganisms have developed the ability to readily switch phenotypes, resulting in a number of differently adapted subpopulations expressing various traits. In evolutionary biology, a particular case of phenotypic heterogeneity that evolved in an unpredictably changing environment has been defined as bet-hedging. Bet-hedging is a risk-spreading strategy where isogenic populations stochastically (randomly) diversify their phenotypes, often resulting in maladapted individuals that suffer lower reproductive success. This fitness trade-off in a specific environment may have a selective advantage upon the sudden environmental shift. Thus, a bet-hedging strategy allows populations to persist in very dynamic habitats, but with a particular fitness cost. In recent years, numerous examples of phenotypic heterogeneity in different microorganisms have been observed, some suggesting bet-hedging. Here, we highlight the latest reports concerning bet-hedging phenomena in various microorganisms to show how versatile this strategy is within the microbial realms.

We introduce here Constrained Allocation Flux Balance Analysis, CAFBA, in which the biosynthetic costs associated to growth are accounted for in an effective way through a single additional genome-wide constraint. Its roots lie in the experimentally observed pattern of proteome allocation for metabolic functions, allowing to bridge regulation and metabolism in a transparent way under the principle of growth-rate maximization. We provide a simple method to solve CAFBA efficiently and propose an ``ensemble averaging'' procedure to account for unknown protein costs. Applying this approach to modeling E. coli metabolism, we find that, as the growth rate increases, CAFBA solutions cross over from respiratory, growth-yield maximizing states (preferred at slow growth) to fermentative states with carbon overflow (preferred at fast growth). In addition, CAFBA allows for quantitatively accurate predictions on the rate of acetate excretion and growth yield based on only 3 parameters determined by empirical growth laws.},

  abstract = {Periodic forcing of nonlinear oscillators leads to a large number of dynamic behaviors. The coupling of the cell cycle to the circadian clock provides a biological realization of such forcing. A previous model of forcing leads to nontrivial relations between correlations along cell lineages. Here, we present a simplified two-dimensional nonlinear map for the periodic forcing of the cell cycle. Using high-throughput single-cell microscopy, we have studied the correlations between cell-cycle duration in discrete lineages of several different organisms, including those with known coupling to a circadian clock and those without known coupling to a circadian clock. The model reproduces the paradoxical correlations and predicts new features that can be compared with the experimental data. By fitting the model to the data, we extract the important parameters that govern the dynamics. Interestingly, the model reproduces bimodal distributions for cell-cycle duration, as well as the gating of cell division by the phase of the clock, without having been explicitly fed into the model. In addition, the model predicts that circadian coupling may increase cell-to-cell variability in a clonal population of cells. In agreement with this prediction, deletion of the circadian clock reduces variability. Our results show that simple correlations can identify systems under periodic forcing and that studies of nonlinear coupling of biological oscillators provide insight into basic cellular processes of growth.},

  abstract = {Background and objective Analysis of rhythmic data has become an important aspect in biological and medical science, as well as other fields of science. Parametric methods based on trigonometric regression reflect several advantages in comparison to their alternatives. Software packages for parametric analysis of rhythmic data are mostly based on a single-component cosinor model, which is not able to describe asymmetric rhythms that might reflect multiple peaks per period. Moreover, a basic cosinor model is unable to describe rhythmicity that is changed with time. Here, we present some important extensions of the recently developed CosinorPy Python package to address these gaps. Methods The extended package CosinorPy provides the functionalities to perform a detailed individual or comparative analysis of rhythms reflecting (1) multiple asymmetric peaks per period, (2) forced, damped, or sustained rhythms, and (3) shift of the midline statistics of rhythm over time. In all these cases the package is able to assess the (differential) rhythmicity parameters, evaluate their significance and confidence intervals, and provide a set of publication-ready figures. Results We demonstrate the package in some typical scenarios that incorporate different types of rhythmic dynamics, such as asymmetric, damped, and forced rhythms. We show that the proposed implementation of a generalised cosinor model is capable of reducing the error of estimated rhythmicity parameters in cases that tend to be problematic for alternative models. The implementation of the presented package is available together with scripts to reproduce the reported results at https://github.com/mmoskon/CosinorPy. Conclusion According to our knowledge, CosinorPy currently presents the only implementation that is able to cover all the above scenarios using a parametric model with vast applications in biology and medicine as well as in other scientific domains.},

Physicochemical properties such as pH and macromolecular crowding are essential to all molecular processes in cells and require maintenance. Whether a drift in physicochemical properties contributes to the overall decline of homeostasis in aging is not known. Here, we show that the cytosol of yeast cells acidifies modestly in early aging and sharply after senescence. Using a macromolecular crowding sensor optimized for long-term FRET measurements, we show that crowding is rather stable and that the stability of crowding is a stronger predictor for lifespan than the absolute crowding levels. Additionally, in aged cells, we observe drastic changes in organellar volume, leading to crowding on the micrometer scale, which we term organellar crowding. Our measurements provide an initial framework of physicochemical parameters of replicatively aged yeast cells.},

However, systematically identifying and studying such community structure in complicated networks is not easy, especially when the network interactions change over time or contain multiple types of connections, as seen in many biological regulatory networks or social networks. Mucha et al. (p. 876) developed a mathematical method to allow detection of communities that may be critical functional units of such networks. Application to real-world tasks\textemdash like making sense of the voting record in the U.S. Senate\textemdash demonstrated the promise of the method. Network science is an interdisciplinary endeavor, with methods and applications drawn from across the natural, social, and information sciences. A prominent problem in network science is the algorithmic detection of tightly connected groups of nodes known as communities. We developed a generalized framework of network quality functions that allowed us to study the community structure of arbitrary multislice networks, which are combinations of individual networks coupled through links that connect each node in one network slice to itself in other slices. This framework allows studies of community structure in a general setting encompassing networks that evolve over time, have multiple types of links (multiplexity), and have multiple scales. A general mathematical method used to identify closely interacting groups can explain the behavior of complicated networks.

  abstract = {The field of systems biology has developed under the acknowledgement that quantitative approaches are necessary to fully understand the complexities that shape cells' structure and behaviour. The development of automated microscopy protocols has led to the accumulation of high-throughput data sets but the high resolution of modern imaging hardware compounded with time series generates an analysis bottleneck. In this thesis I discuss the methods and tools we have developed to process live-cell imaging time series in a fully automated manner. I then showcase a situation in which such an analysis proves essential to extract biological insight on the protein aggregation dynamics of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In chapter 1 I develop a method that uses machine learning algorithms to track single-cell time-lapses based only on cell outlines, and is robust to experimental and technical noise, as well as varied experimental conditions. I explain the statistical considerations necessary to compare long-term tracking algorithms and discuss useful benchmark metrics for time-inclusive image analyses. In chapter 2 I use the cell segmentation and tracking software as a base to develop an analysis tool that automates all steps in a reproducible manner. It is the fastest tool as far as we are aware to process data from pillar-style microfludic devices, improving on existing pipelines by at least an eight-fold factor, and thus changing the ways we can study cell decision-making at the single-cell level. In chapter 3 I review the current available computational tools that may be useful for developing data analysis software for biology. I then propose a system for sustainable scientific software development that uses modern development technologies and enables community-driven efforts. In the last chapter I use the image-processing pipeline to study the protein aggregation dynamics of metabolic enzymes that form reversible aggregates via phase separation. We complement this with single-cell physiology information to gain a deeper understanding of the impact of these proteins on yeast cells' growth and division. Heterogeneous responses, distinguishable by using mutant strains with varying aggregation phenotypes, are studied using high-throughput correlations. This work shows that the development of computational tools can make the acquisition of biological insight faster and increases reproducibility while providing a toolset to tackle a problem that had no practical alternatives before. It also furthers biological understanding of a conserved phenomenon such as reversible protein aggregation, in a way only possible by studying behaviour and physiology of thousands of cells at the same time, a feat that up until now required much correction by hand to be practical. My thesis aims to pave the way for more comprehensive analyses using aggregated high-quality data.},

This is especially true of the anaphase promoting complex (APC), the machine that triggers chromosome segregation and the exit of mitosis by targeting securin and mitotic cyclins for destruction.

  abstract = {Background In biological systems, redox reactions are central to most cellular processes and the redox potential of the intracellular compartment dictates whether a particular reaction can or cannot occur. Indeed the widespread use of redox reactions in biological systems makes their detailed description outside the scope of one review. Scope of the Review Here we will focus on how system-wide redox changes can alter the reaction and transcriptional landscape of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To understand this we explore the major determinants of cellular redox potential, how these are sensed by the cell and the dynamic responses elicited. Major Conclusions Redox regulation is a large and complex system that has the potential to rapidly and globally alter both the reaction and transcription landscapes. Although we have a basic understanding of many of the sub-systems and a partial understanding of the transcriptional control, we are far from understanding how these systems integrate to produce coherent responses. We argue that this non-linear system self-organises, and that the output in many cases is temperature-compensated oscillations that may temporally partition incompatible reactions in vivo. General Significance Redox biochemistry impinges on most of cellular processes and has been shown to underpin ageing and many human diseases. Integrating the complexity of redox signalling and regulation is perhaps one of the most challenging areas of biology.

  abstract = {When yeast cells are grown continuously at high cell density, a respiratory oscillation percolates throughout the population. Many essential cellular functions have been shown to be separated temporally during each cycle; however, the regulatory mechanisms involved in oscillatory dynamics remain to be elucidated. Through GC-MS analysis we found that the majority of metabolites show oscillatory dynamics, with 70\% of the identified metabolite concentrations peaking in conjunction with NAD(P)H. Through statistical analyses of microarray data, we identified that biosynthetic events have a defined order, and this program is initiated when respiration rates are increasing. We then combined metabolic, transcriptional data and statistical analyses of transcription factor activity, identified the top oscillatory parameters, and filtered a large-scale yeast interaction network according to these parameters. The analyses and controlled experimental perturbation provided evidence that a transcriptional complex formed part of the timing circuit for biosynthetic, reductive, and cell cycle programs in the cell. This circuitry does not act in isolation because both have strong translational, proteomic, and metabolic regulatory mechanisms. Our data lead us to conclude that the regulation of the respiratory oscillation revolves around coupled subgraphs containing large numbers of proteins and metabolites, with a potential to oscillate, and no definable hierarchy, i.e., heterarchical control.},

  abstract = {A plethora of data is accumulating from high throughput methods on metabolites, coenzymes, proteins, lipids and nucleic acids and their interactions as well as the signalling and regulatory functions and pathways of the cellular network. The frozen moment viewed in a single discrete time sample requires frequent repetition and updating before any appreciation of the dynamics of component interaction becomes possible. Even then in a sample derived from a cell population, time-averaging of processes and events that occur in out-of-phase individuals blur the detailed complexity of single cell.Continuously grown cultures of yeast spontaneously self-synchronise and provide resolution of detailed temporal structure. Continuous online monitoring (O2 electrode and membrane-inlet mass spectrometry for O2, CO2 and H2S; direct fluorimetry for NAD(P)H and flavins) gives dynamic information from timescales of minutes to hours. When these data are supplemented with mass spectrometry-based metabolomics and transcriptomics, the predominantly oscillatory behaviour of network components becomes evident, where respiration cycles between increased oxygen consumption (oxidative phase) and decreased oxygen consumption (reductive phase). This ultradian clock provides a coordinating function that links mitochondrial energetics and redox balance to transcriptional regulation, mitochondrial structure and organelle remodelling, DNA duplication and chromatin dynamics. Ultimately, anabolism and catabolism become globally partitioned: mediation is by direct feedback loops between the energetic and redox state of the cell and chromatin architecture via enzymatic co-factors and co-enzymes.Multi-oscillatory outputs were observed in dissolved gases with 12-h, 40-min and 4-min periods, and statistical self-similarity in Power Spectral and Relative Dispersional analyses: i.e. complex non-linear behaviour and a functional scale-free network operating simultaneously on several timescales. Fast sampling (at 10 or 1 Hz) of NAD(P)H fluorescence revealed subharmonic components of the 40-min signal at 20,10 and 3\textendash 5 min. The latter corresponds to oscillations directly observed and imaged by 2-photon microscopy in surface-attached cells. Signalling between time domains is suggested by studies with protonophore effectors of mitochondrial energetics. Multi-oscillatory states impinge on the complex reactome (where concentrations of most chemical species oscillate) and network functionality is made more comprehensible when in vivo time structure is taken into account.},

In particular, biological rhythms, which typically arise via synchronization of many self-oscillatory cells, often play important functional roles in living systems. One of the standard theoretical methods for analyzing synchronization dynamics of oscillatory systems is the phase reduction for weakly perturbed limit-cycle oscillators, which allows us to simplify nonlinear dynamical models exhibiting stable limit-cycle oscillations to a simple one-dimensional phase equation. Recently, the classical phase reduction method has been generalized to infinite-dimensional oscillatory systems such as spatially extended systems and time-delayed systems, and also to include amplitude degrees of freedom representing deviations of the system state from the unperturbed limit cycle. In this chapter, we discuss the method of phase-amplitude reduction for spatially extended reaction-diffusion systems exhibiting stable oscillatory patterns. As an application, we analyze entrainment of a reaction-diffusion system exhibiting limit-cycle oscillations by an optimized periodic forcing and additional feedback stabilization.},

  abstract = {A novel mini-scale chemostat system was developed for the physiological characterization of 10-ml cultures. The parallel operation of eight such mini-scale chemostats was exploited for systematic 13C analysis of intracellular fluxes over a broad range of growth rates in glucose-limited Escherichia coli. As expected, physiological variables changed monotonously with the dilution rate, allowing for the assessment of maintenance metabolism. Despite the linear dependence of total cellular carbon influx on dilution rate, the distribution of almost all major fluxes varied nonlinearly with dilution rate. Most prominent were the distinct maximum of glyoxylate shunt activity and the concomitant minimum of tricarboxylic acid cycle activity at low to intermediate dilution rates of 0.05 to 0.2 h-1. During growth on glucose, this glyoxylate shunt activity is best understood from a network perspective as the recently described phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)-glyoxylate cycle that oxidizes PEP (or pyruvate) to CO2. At higher or extremely low dilution rates, in vivo PEP-glyoxylate cycle activity was low or absent. The step increase in pentose phosphate pathway activity at around 0.2 h-1 was not related to the cellular demand for the reduction equivalent NADPH, since NADPH formation was 20 to 50\% in excess of the anabolic demand at all dilution rates. The results demonstrate that mini-scale continuous cultivation enables quantitative and parallel characterization of intra- and extracellular phenotypes in steady state, thereby greatly reducing workload and costs for stable-isotope experiments.},

This tight control indicates that maintenance of a cell type-specific cell density is important for cell function. Indeed, pathological conditions such as cellular senescence are accompanied by changes in cell density. Despite the apparent importance of cell-type-specific density, we know little about how cell density affects cell function, how it is controlled, and how it sometimes changes as part of a developmental process or in response to changes in the environment. The recent development of new technologies to accurately measure the cell density of single cells in suspension and in tissues is likely to provide answers to these important questions.},

One highly effective approach is the optimization of the quality function known as "modularity" over the possible divisions of a network. Here I show that the modularity can be expressed in terms of the eigenvectors of a characteristic matrix for the network, which I call the modularity matrix, and that this expression leads to a spectral algorithm for community detection that returns results of demonstrably higher quality than competing methods in shorter running times. I illustrate the method with applications to several published network data sets.},

Insertion of a hairpin containing GFP {$\beta$}-\-strands 10 and 11 into a surface loop of a target protein provides two chain crossings between the target and the reconstituted GFP compared with the single connection afforded by terminal GFP fusions. This strategy was tested by inserting this hairpin into a loop of another fluorescent protein, sfCherry.

Analysis of the complex shows that the reconstituted GFP is attached to the target protein (sfCherry) in a structurally ordered way.

Using native elongating transcript analysis (NET-seq), we show that transcription itself is a component of bi-modal switches, facilitating reciprocal expression in gene clusters. HMS2, encoding a growth-regulated transcription factor, switches between sense- or antisense-dominant states that also coordinate up- and down-regulation of transcription at neighbouring genes. Engineering HMS2 reveals alternative mono-, di- or tri-cistronic and antisense transcription units (TUs), using different promoter and terminator combinations, that underlie state-switching. Promoters or terminators are excluded from functional TUs by read-through transcriptional interference, while antisense TUs insulate downstream genes from interference. We propose that the balance of transcriptional insulation and interference at gene clusters facilitates gene expression switches during intracellular and extracellular environmental change.},

Similarly, up-modulation of single genes, and hence of the dependent enzyme concentrations, is frequently found to be ineffective in increasing the flux in the pathway in which the enzyme occurs. This insensitivity to enzyme variation is demonstrated experimentally for five separate enzymes in the tryptophan synthesis system of yeast, first by down-modulation of the gene dose and secondly by increasing the dose using multi-copy vectors. Such a lack of response is discussed in terms of the concepts of metabolic control analysis. When these five enzymes, however, were simultaneously increased by a multi-copy vector carrying all five genes, a substantial elevation of the flux to tryptophan was observed. These findings revealed a new phenomenon, namely the more than additive effects on the flux of simultaneous elevations of several enzyme activities.},

We sequenced, assembled, annotated and analyzed its genome. Single-nucleotide variations (SNV), insertions/deletions (indels) and differences in genome organization compared to the reference strain S. cerevisiae S288C were analyzed. In addition to a few large deletions and duplications, nearly 3000 indels were identified in the CEN.PK113-7D genome relative to S288C. These differences were overrepresented in genes whose functions are related to transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodelling. Some of these variations were caused by unstable tandem repeats, suggesting an innate evolvability of the corresponding genes. Besides a previously characterized mutation in adenylate cyclase, the CEN.PK113-7D genome sequence revealed a significant enrichment of non-synonymous mutations in genes encoding for components of the cAMP signalling pathway. Some phenotypic characteristics of the CEN.PK113-7D strains were explained by the presence of additional specific metabolic genes relative to S288C. In particular, the presence of the BIO1 and BIO6 genes correlated with a biotin prototrophy of CEN.PK113-7D. Furthermore, the copy number, chromosomal location and sequences of the MAL loci were resolved. The assembled sequence reveals that CEN.PK113-7D has a mosaic genome that combines characteristics of laboratory strains and wild-industrial strains.},

Here we study the relation between accuracy and data efficiency in an atlas of machine learning models trained on datasets of varied size and sequence diversity. We show that deep learning can achieve good prediction accuracy with much smaller datasets than previously thought. We demonstrate that controlled sequence diversity leads to substantial gains in data efficiency and employed Explainable AI to show that convolutional neural networks can finely discriminate between input DNA sequences.

Only a fraction of cellular protein can, however, be allocated to enzymes of intermediary metabolism and consequently metabolic trade-offs may take place. One such trade-off, aerobic fermentation, occurs in both yeast (the Crabtree effect) and cancer cells (the Warburg effect) and has been a scientific challenge for decades. Here we show, using flux balance analysis combined with in vitro measured enzyme specific activities, that fermentation is more catalytically efficient than respiration, i.e. it produces more ATP per protein mass. And that the switch to fermentation at high growth rates therefore is a consequence of a high ATP production rate, provided by a limited pool of enzymes. The catalytic efficiency is also higher for cells grown on glucose compared to galactose and ethanol, which may explain the observed differences in their growth rates. The enzyme F1F0-ATP synthase (Complex V) was found to have flux control over respiration in the model, and since it is evolutionary conserved, we expect the trade-off to occur in organisms from all kingdoms of life.},

TRX is a small ubiquitous protein with the redox-active site sequence -Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys-.

Various oxidative stimuli, such as UV irradiation, cytokines and some chemicals, promptly induce the expression of TRX. Overexpression of TRX correlates with a wide variety of oxidative stress conditions and, in some cases, TRX has shown promising effects for clinical use, for instance in the attenuation of tissue injury in ischemia reperfusion models.

  abstract = {The intracellular redox state of a cell is to a large extent defined by the concentration ratios of the two pyridine nucleotide systems NADH/NAD+ and NADPH/NADP+ and has a significant influence on product formation in microorganisms. The enzyme pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase, which can catalyse transfer of reducing equivalents between the two nucleotide systems, occurs in several organisms, but not in yeasts. The purpose of this work was to analyse how metabolism during anaerobic growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae might be altered when transfer of reducing equivalents between the two systems is made possible by expression of a cytoplasmic transhydrogenase from Azotobacter vinelandii. We therefore cloned sth, encoding this enzyme, and expressed it under the control of a S. cerevisiae promoter in a strain derived from the industrial model strain S. cerevisiae CBS8066. Anaerobic batch cultivations in high-performance bioreactors were carried out in order to allow quantitative analysis of the effect of transhydrogenase expression on product formation and on the intracellular concentrations of NADH, NAD+, NADPH and NADP+. A specific transhydrogenase activity of 4.53 U/mg protein was measured in the extracts from the strain expressing the sth gene from A. vinelandii, while no transhydrogenase activity could be detected in control strains without the gene. Production of the transhydrogenase caused a significant increase in formation of glycerol and 2-oxoglutarate. Since NADPH is used to convert 2-oxoglutarate to glutamate while glycerol formation increases when excess NADH is formed, this suggested that transhydrogenase converted NADH and NADP+ to NAD+ and NADPH. This was further supported by measurements of the intracellular nucleotide concentrations. Thus, the (NADPH/NADP+):(NADH/NAD+) ratio was reduced from 35 to 17 by the transhydrogenase. The increased formation of 2-oxoglutarate was accompanied by a two-fold decrease in the maximal specific growth rate. Also the biomass and ethanol yields were significantly lowered by the transhydrogenase. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The model was used to calculate intracellular fluxes based on measurements of the uptake of substrates from the medium, the secretion of products from the cells, and of the rate of biomass formation. Furthermore, measurements of the biomass composition and of the activity of key enzymes were used in the calculations. The stoichiometric network consists of 37 pathway reactions involving 43 compounds of which 13 were measured (acetate, CO2, ethanol, glucose, glycerol, NH+ 4, pyruvate, succinate, carbohydrates, DNA, lipids, proteins and RNA). The model was used to calculate the production rates of malate and fumarate and the ethanol measurement was used to validate the model. All rate measurements were performed on glucose-limited continuous cultures in a high-performance bioreactor. Carbon balances closed within 98\%. The calculations comprised flux distributions at specific growth rates of 0.10 and 0.30 h-1. The fluxes through reactions located around important branch points of the metabolism were compared, i.e. the split between the pentose phosphate and the Embden-Meyerhoff-Parnas pathways. Also the model was used to show the probable existence of a redox shunt across the inner mitochondrial membrane consisting of the reactions catalysed by the mitochondrial and the cytosolic alcohol dehydrogenase. Finally it was concluded that cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase is probably not present during growth on glucose.

  abstract = {Nucleosome repositioning at gene promoters is a fundamental aspect of the regulation of gene expression. However, the extent to which nucleosome repositioning is used within eukaryotic genomes is poorly understood. Here we report a comprehensive analysis of nucleosome positions as budding yeast transit through an ultradian cycle in which expression of {$>$}50\% of all genes is highly synchronized. We present evidence of extensive nucleosome repositioning at thousands of gene promoters as genes are activated and repressed. During activation, nucleosomes are relocated to allow sites of general transcription factor binding and transcription initiation to become accessible. The extent of nucleosome shifting is closely related to the dynamic range of gene transcription and generally related to DNA sequence properties and use of the coactivators TFIID or SAGA. However, dynamic gene expression is not limited to SAGA-regulated promoters and is an inherent feature of most genes. While nucleosome repositioning occurs pervasively, we found that a class of genes required for growth experience acute nucleosome shifting as cells enter the cell cycle. Significantly, our data identify that the ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling enzyme Snf2 plays a fundamental role in nucleosome repositioning and the expression of growth genes. We also reveal that nucleosome organization changes extensively in concert with phases of the cell cycle, with large, regularly spaced nucleosome arrays being established in mitosis. Collectively, our data and analysis provide a framework for understanding nucleosome dynamics in relation to fundamental DNA-dependent transactions.},

We have isolated ZWF1 the Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene that encodes G6PD, and identified its transcript and transcription start point. Expression of ZWF1 appears not to be regulated, consistent with its `housekeeping' role. Null mutants lacking G6PD appear to grow normally, but are more sensitive than wild type to oxidizing agents that presumably reduce the level of NADPH. This suggests that G6PD has a major role in NADPH production in yeast. Regulation of GALI expression appears normal in zwfl mutants, suggesting that the pentose phosphate pathway is not involved in glucose repression. The predicted amino acid sequence of yeast G6PD is highly similar to the sequence of the Drosophila, human, and rat enzymes, except near its N terminus, where the yeast and Drosophila sequences diverge from that of human and rat.},

These multi-strain GEMs can be used to study pan-metabolic capabilities and strain-specific differences across a species, thus providing insights into its range of lifestyles. Unlike the original Protocol, this procedure is scalable and can be partly automated with the Supplementary Jupyter notebook Tutorial. This Protocol Extension joins the ranks of other comparable methods for generating models such as CarveMe and KBase. This extension of the original Protocol takes on the order of weeks to multiple months to complete depending on the availability of a suitable reference model.},

  abstract = {CO2 production has been followed by manometry in synchronous and asynchronous cultures of Schizosaccharomyces pombe prepared by elutriation from the same initial culture. The rate of production follows a linear pattern in synchronous cultures with a rate change once per cycle at the time of cell division. This pattern is most clearly shown in oscillations of the difference between values of the second differential (acceleration) for the synchronous and asynchronous cultures. The association between the rate change and the time of division is maintained during growth speeded up in rich medium and slowed down in poor medium and at lower temperature. It is also maintained after a shift-up in temperature. Results with wee mutants suggest that the association is with the S period rather than division itself. The rate and acceleration of CO2 production are approximately proportional to cell size (protein content) in asynchronous cultures. When synchronous cultures of the temperature-sensitive mutants cdc2.33 and cdc2.33 wee1.6 are shifted up to the restrictive temperature, the DNA-division cycle is blocked. The oscillatory pattern of CO2 production, however, continues for one to two cycles until the acceleration reaches a constant value, after which the oscillations are undetectable. This point is reached later in the double mutant and there is a phase difference in the oscillations compared to those in the single mutant. With both blocked mutants the `free-running' oscillations are about 15\% shorter than the normal cycle time. There are well-known examples of such oscillations in eggs but they are rare in growing systems.},

These two phases correlate to high activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) that trigger S-G2-M events and CDK antagonists that stabilize G1 phase. We associated these ``alternative phases'' with the coexistence of two stable steady states of the biochemical reactions among CDKs and their antagonists.2,3 Transitions between these steady states (G1-to-S and M-to-G1) are driven by ``helper'' proteins. The fact that the transitions are irreversible is guaranteed by a ``latching'' property of the molecular switches, as we have argued in previous publications.4,5 Here, we show that if the latch is broken, then the biochemical reactions can swing back-and-forth across the transitions; either G1-S-G1-S \ldots{} (periodic DNA replication without mitosis or cell division) or M-(G1)-M-(G1) \ldots{} (periodic Cdc14 release, without fully exiting mitosis). Using mathematical modeling of the molecular control circuit in budding yeast, we provide a fresh account of aberrant cell cycles in mutant strains: endoreplication in the clb1-5{$\Delta$} strain6 and periodic release and resequestration of Cdc14 (an ``exit'' phosphatase) in the CLB2kd{$\Delta$} strain.7,8 In our opinion, these ``endocycles'' are not autonomous oscillatory modules that must be entrained by the CDK oscillator6,7 but rather inadvertent and deleterious oscillations that are normally suppressed by the CDK latching-gate mechanism.8},

Overexpression of full-length OYE2 suppresses Bax lethality in yeast, lowers endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS), increases resistance to H\textsubscript{2}O\textsubscript{2}-induced programmed cell death (PCD), and significantly lowers ROS levels generated by organic prooxidants. Reciprocally, {$\Delta$}\emph{oye2} yeast strains are sensitive to prooxidant-induced PCD. Overexpression and knock-out analysis indicate these OYE2 antioxidant activities are opposed by OYE3, a highly homologous heterodimerizing protein, which functions as a prooxidant promoting H\textsubscript{2}O\textsubscript{2}-induced PCD in wild type yeast. To exert its effect OYE3 requires the presence of OYE2. Deletion of the 12 C-terminal amino acids and catalytic inactivation of OYE2 by a Y197F mutation enhance significantly survival upon H\textsubscript{2}O\textsubscript{2}-induced PCD in wild type cells, but accelerate PCD in {$\Delta$}\emph{oye3} cells, implicating the oye2p-oye3p heterodimer for promoting cell death upon oxidative stress. Unexpectedly, a strain with a double knock-out of these genes ({$\Delta$}\emph{oye2 oye3}) is highly resistant to H\textsubscript{2}O\textsubscript{2}-induced PCD, exhibits increased respiratory capacity, and undergoes less cell death during the adaptive response in chronological aging. Simultaneous deletion of OYE2 and other antioxidant genes hyperinduces endogenous levels of ROS, promoting H\textsubscript{2}O\textsubscript{2}-induced cell death: in {$\Delta$}\emph{oye2 glr1} yeast high levels of oxidized glutathione elicited gross morphological aberrations involving the actin cytoskeleton and defects in organelle partitioning. Altering the ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione by exogenous addition of GSH fully reversed these alterations.

However, density varied during the cell cycle, decreasing during G2, increasing in mitosis and cytokinesis, and dropping rapidly at cell birth. These density variations were explained by a constant rate of biomass synthesis, coupled to slowdown of volume growth during cell division and rapid expansion post-cytokinesis. Arrest at specific cell-cycle stages exacerbated density changes. Spatially heterogeneous patterns of density suggested links between density regulation, tip growth, and intracellular osmotic pressure. Our results demonstrate that systematic density variations during the cell cycle are predominantly due to modulation of volume expansion, and reveal functional consequences of density gradients and cell-cycle arrests.},

Cellular dynamics of cAMP have been investigated using a series of fluorescent indicators; however, their sensitivity was sub-optimal for detecting cAMP dynamics at a low concentration range, due to a low ligand affinity and/or poor dynamic range. Seeking an indicator with improved detection sensitivity, we performed insertion screening of circularly permuted mApple, a red fluorescent protein, into the cAMP-binding motif of PKA regulatory subunit I{$\alpha$} and developed an improved cAMP indicator named R-FlincA (Red Fluorescent indicator for cAMP). Its increased affinity (Kd\,=\,0.3 {$\mu$}M) and expanded dynamic range (860\% at pH 7.2) allowed the detection of subtle changes in the cellular cAMP dynamics at sub-{$\mu$}M concentrations, which could not be easily observed with existing indicators. Increased detection sensitivity also strengthened the advantages of using R-FlincA as a red fluorescent indicator, as it permits a series of applications, including multi-channel/function imaging of multiple second messengers and combinatorial imaging with photo-manipulation. These results strongly suggest that R-FlincA is a promising tool that accelerates cAMP research by revealing unobserved cAMP dynamics at a low concentration range.},

  abstract = {Nutrients including glucose, nitrogen, sulfur, zinc, and iron are involved in the regulation of chronological lifespan (CLS) of yeast, which serves as a model of the lifespan of differentiated cells of higher organisms. Herein, we show that magnesium (Mg2+) depletion extends CLS of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe through a mechanism involving the Ecl1 gene family. We discovered that ecl1+ expression, which extends CLS, responds to Mg2+ depletion. Therefore, we investigated the underlying intracellular responses. In amino acid auxotrophic strains, Mg2+ depletion robustly induces ecl1+ expression through the activation of the general amino acid control (GAAC) pathway\textemdash the equivalent of the amino acid response of mammals. Polysome analysis indicated that the expression of Ecl1 family genes was required for regulating ribosome amount when cells were starved, suggesting that Ecl1 family gene products control the abundance of ribosomes, which contributes to longevity through the activation of the evolutionarily conserved GAAC pathway. The present study extends our understanding of the cellular response to Mg2+ depletion and its influence on the mechanism controlling longevity.},

Here, we describe how to use some of the BACMMAN features, including (i) segmentation and tracking of bacteria and intracellular fluorescent spots, (ii) visualization and editing of the results, (iii) configuration of the image-processing pipeline for different datasets and (iv) BACMMAN coupling to data analysis software for visualization and analysis of data subsets with specific properties. Among software specifically dedicated to the analysis of mother machine data, only BACMMAN allows segmentation and tracking of both bacteria and intracellular spots.

While circadian periods have been shown to correlate with entrainment phases, and clock amplitude influences the phase response of an oscillator to pulse-like zeitgeber signals, the co-modulations of amplitude and periods, which we term twist, have not been studied in detail. In this paper we define two concepts: parametric twist refers to amplitude-period correlations arising in ensembles of self-sustained clocks in the absence of external inputs, and phase space twist refers to the co-modulation of an individual clock's amplitude and period in response to external zeitgebers. Our findings show that twist influences the interaction of oscillators with the environment, facilitating entrainment, fastening recovery to pulse-like perturbations or modifying the response of an individual clock to coupling. This theoretical framework might be applied to understand the emerging properties of other oscillating systems.},

  abstract = {Circadian clocks are endogenous oscillators present in almost all cells that drive daily rhythms in physiology and behavior. There are two mechanisms that have been proposed to explain how circadian rhythms are generated in mammalian cells: through a transcription-translation feedback loop (TTFL) and based on oxidation/reduction reactions, both of which are intrinsically stochastic and heterogeneous at the single cell level. In order to explore the emerging properties of stochastic and heterogeneous redox oscillators, we simplify a recently developed kinetic model of redox oscillations to an amplitude-phase oscillator with `twist' (period-amplitude correlation) and subject to Gaussian noise. We show that noise and heterogeneity alone lead to fast desynchronization, and that coupling between noisy oscillators can establish robust and synchronized rhythms with amplitude expansions and tuning of the period due to twist. Coupling a network of redox oscillators to a simple model of the TTFL also contributes to synchronization, large amplitudes and fine-tuning of the period for appropriate interaction strengths. These results provide insights into how the circadian clock compensates randomness from intracellular sources and highlight the importance of noise, heterogeneity and coupling in the context of circadian oscillators.},

At the cellular level, the molecular clockwork consists of a complex network of interlocked feedback loops. This chapter discusses self-sustained circadian oscillators in the context of nonlinear dynamics theory. We suggest basic steps that can help in constructing a mathematical model and introduce how self-sustained generations can be modeled using ordinary differential equations. Moreover, we discuss how coupled oscillators synchronize among themselves or entrain to periodic signals. The development of mathematical models over the last years has helped to understand such complex network systems and to highlight the basic building blocks in which oscillating systems are built upon. We argue that, through theoretical predictions, the use of simple models can guide experimental research and is thus suitable to model biological systems qualitatively.},

In spite of intensive experimental and model studies there are still gaps in our understanding of these glycolytic oscillations, e.g. the mechanisms by which they arise, why they have been preserved throughout evolution, and what their potential functions in the cell could be. In the current paper new experimental observations will be presented showing that many variables, that were hitherto considered unrelated to glycolysis, oscillate synchronously with glycolytic intermediates. Furthermore, a strong coupling between glycolysis and the polarisation of intracellular water is presented, suggesting that water has a strong influence on metabolism. This challenges our current understanding of the mechanism behind the glycolytic oscillations. Finally, it is proposed that the function of metabolic oscillations is to maintain the cell in a state of constant low entropy.},

The responses of glycolytic and membrane potential oscillations to a number of inhibitors of glycolysis, mitochondrial electron flow, and mitochondrial and plasma membrane H+-ATPase were investigated. Furthermore, the glycolytic flux was determined as the rate of production of ethanol in a number of different situations (changing pH or the presence and absence of inhibitors). Finally, the intracellular pH was determined and shown to oscillate. The results support earlier work suggesting that the coupling between glycolysis and mitochondrial membrane potential is mediated by the ADP/ATP antiporter and the mitochondrial F0F1-ATPase. The results further suggest that ATP hydrolysis, through the action of the mitochondrial F0F1-ATPase and plasma membrane H+-ATPase, are important in regulating these oscillations. We conclude that it is glycolysis that drives the oscillations in mitochondrial membrane potential.},

All current models of the molecular circadian clockwork in eukaryotic cells are based on transcription\textendash translation feedback loops. Non-transcriptional mechanisms in the clockwork have been difficult to study in mammalian systems. We circumvented these problems by developing novel assays using human red blood cells, which have no nucleus (or DNA) and therefore cannot perform transcription. Our results show that transcription is not required for circadian oscillations in humans, and that non-transcriptional events seem to be sufficient to sustain cellular circadian rhythms. Using red blood cells, we found that peroxiredoxins, highly conserved antioxidant proteins, undergo {$\sim$}24-hour redox cycles, which persist for many days under constant conditions (that is, in the absence of external cues). Moreover, these rhythms are entrainable (that is, tunable by environmental stimuli) and temperature-compensated, both key features of circadian rhythms. We anticipate that our findings will facilitate more sophisticated cellular clock models, highlighting the interdependency of transcriptional and non-transcriptional oscillations in potentially all eukaryotic cells.},

YROs share features with circadian rhythms and interact with, but are independent of, the cell division cycle. Here, we show that YROs minimise energy expenditure by restricting protein synthesis until sufficient resources are stored, while maintaining osmotic homeostasis and protein quality control. Although nutrient supply is constant, cells sequester and store metabolic resources via increased transport, autophagy and biomolecular condensation. Replete stores trigger increased H+ export which stimulates TORC1 and liberates proteasomes, ribosomes, chaperones and metabolic enzymes from non-membrane bound compartments. This facilitates translational bursting, liquidation of storage carbohydrates, increased ATP turnover, and the export of osmolytes. We propose that dynamic regulation of ion transport and metabolic plasticity are required to maintain osmotic and protein homeostasis during remodelling of eukaryotic proteomes, and that bioenergetic constraints selected for temporal organisation that promotes oscillatory behaviour.},

Each augmented soundscape is made by digitally adding "maskers" (bird, water, wind, traffic, construction, or silence) to urban soundscape recordings at fixed soundscape-to-masker ratios. Responses were then collected by asking participants to rate how pleasant, annoying, eventful, uneventful, vibrant, monotonous, chaotic, calm, and appropriate each augmented soundscape was, in accordance with ISO 12913-2:2018. Participants also provided relevant demographic information and completed standard psychological questionnaires.

Aging and age-related phenotypes are prominent virulence traits that contribute to the resilience of Cn to host responses and antifungals. Traditional methods to study aging~in Cn are expensive, inefficient and in need of improvement. Here, we demonstrate the development and use of a High-Throughput Yeast Aging Analysis for Cryptococcus (HYAAC) microfluidic device to better study aging and age-associated genes in Cn. Compared to traditional methods, the HYAAC is superior in its efficiency to isolate, manipulate and observe old cells for analysis. It allows for the trapping and tracking of individual cells over the course of their lifespan, allowing for more precise measurements of lifespan, tracking of age-related phenotypes with age, and a more high-throughput ability to investigate genes associated with aging.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h2{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/h2{$><$}p{$>$}Organisms must either synthesize or assimilate essential organic compounds to survive. The homocysteine synthase Met15 has been considered essential for inorganic sulfur assimilation in yeast since its discovery in the 1970s. As a result, \emph{MET15} has served as a genetic marker for hundreds of experiments that play a foundational role in eukaryote genetics and systems biology. Nevertheless, we demonstrate here through structural and evolutionary modeling, \emph{in vitro} kinetic assays, and genetic complementation, that an alternative homocysteine synthase encoded by the previously uncharacterized gene YLL058W enables cells lacking Met15 to assimilate enough inorganic sulfur for survival and proliferation. These cells however fail to grow in patches or liquid cultures unless provided with exogenous methionine or other organosulfurs. We show that this growth failure, which has historically justified the status of \emph{MET15} as a classic auxotrophic marker, is largely explained by toxic accumulation of the gas hydrogen sulfide due to a metabolic bottleneck. When patched or cultured with a hydrogen sulfide chelator, and when propagated as colony grids, cells without Met15 assimilate inorganic sulfur and grow, and cells with Met15 achieve even higher yields. Thus, Met15 is not essential for inorganic sulfur assimilation in yeast. Instead, \emph{MET15} is the first example of a yeast gene whose loss conditionally prevents growth in a manner that depends on local gas exchange. Our results have broad implications for investigations of sulfur metabolism, including studies of stress response, methionine restriction, and aging. More generally, our findings illustrate how unappreciated experimental variables can obfuscate biological discovery.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Together with oscillating elements of the cyclin/CDK machinery, this oscillator might form a coupled oscillator system, from which cell-cycle control emerges. The topology of interactions between the metabolic oscillator and the elements of the cyclin/CDK machinery, however, remains unknown. Using single-cell metabolic and cell-cycle dynamics in yeast, and solving an inverse problem with a system of Kuramoto~oscillators, we inferred how the metabolic oscillator interacts with the cyclin/CDK machinery. The identified and experimentally validated interaction topology shows that the early and late cell cycle are independently driven by metabolism. While in this topology, the S phase is coordinated by START. We obtained no support for a strong interaction between early and late cell cycle. The identified high-level interaction topology will guide future efforts to discover the molecular links between metabolism and the cell cycle.},

We present evidence that the three membrane proteins Ato1p, Ato2p, and Ato3p, members of the YaaH family, are involved in ammonia production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae colonies. The acid-to-alkali transition is connected with decrease of mitochondrial oxidative catabolism and by peroxisome activation, which in parallel with activation of biosynthetic pathways contribute to decrease the general stress level in colonies. These metabolic features characterize a novel survival strategy used by yeast under starvation conditions prevalent in nature.},

Furthermore, the GAL system consists of two positive (activating) feedback and one negative (repressing) feedback loops. These individual mechanisms, elucidated through experimental approach, can be integrated to obtain a system-wide behavior.

They catalyze the reversible transfer of reducing equivalents between the two nicotinamide cofactors. The soluble transhydrogenase from Escherichia coli (SthA) has found wide use in both in vivo and in vitro applications to steer reducing equivalents towards NADPH-requiring reactions. However, mechanistic insight into SthA function is still lacking. In this work, we present a biochemical characterization of SthA, focusing for the first time on the reactivity of the flavoenzyme with molecular oxygen. We report on oxidase activity of SthA that takes place both during transhydrogenation and in the absence of an oxidized nicotinamide cofactor as an electron acceptor. We find that this reaction produces the reactive oxygen species (ROS) hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion. Furthermore, we explore the evolutionary significance of the well conserved CXXXXT motif that distinguishes STHs from the related family of flavoprotein disulfide reductases in which a CXXXXC motif is conserved. Our mutational analysis revealed the cysteine and threonine combination in SthA leads to better coupling efficiency of transhydrogenation and reduced ROS release compared to enzyme variants with mutated motifs. These results expand our mechanistic understanding of SthA by highlighting reactivity with molecular oxygen and the importance of the evolutionarily conserved sequence motif.},

We reveal a dynamic positive feedback loop between RpoS and growth rate that produces multi-generation RpoS pulses. We do so experimentally using single-cell, time-lapse microscopy and microfluidics and theoretically with a stochastic model. Next, we demonstrate~that E. coli prepares for sudden stress by entering prolonged periods of slow growth mediated by RpoS. This dynamic phenotype is captured by the RpoS-growth feedback model.

The fluorescence of Escherichia coli cells expressing each of eighteen proteins from Pyrobaculum aerophilum as fusions with superfolder GFP was proportional to total protein expression. In contrast, fluorescence of folding reporter GFP fusion proteins was strongly correlated with the productive folding yield of the passenger protein.

Recent advances have shown that glutathione (GSH) seems to be involved in the response of yeasts to different nutritional and oxidative stresses. When the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is starved for sulfur or nitrogen nutrients, GSH may be mobilized to ensure cellular maintenance. Glutathione S-transferases may be involved in the detoxification of electrophilic xenobiotics. Vacuolar transport of metal derivatives of GSH ensure resistance to metal stress. Growth of methylotrophic yeasts on methanol results in the formation of an excess formaldehyde that is detoxified by a GSH-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase. Growth of yeasts on glycerol results in the accumulation of methylglyoxal detoxified by the glyoxalase pathway. Glutathione per se can react with oxidative agents or is involved in the oxidative stress response through glutathione peroxidase.},

Cells receive stochastic signals, perform detection and transduction with stochastic biochemistry, and grow and die in stochastic environments. Here we review progress in going from the molecular details to the information-processing strategies cells use in their decision-making. Such strategies are fundamentally influenced by stochasticity. We argue that the cellular decision-making can only be probabilistic and occurs at three levels. First, cells must infer from noisy signals the probable current and anticipated future state of their environment. Second, they must weigh the costs and benefits of each potential response, given that future. Third, cells must decide in the presence of other, potentially competitive, decision-makers. In this context, we discuss cooperative responses where some individuals can appear to sacrifice for the common good. We believe that decision-making strategies will be conserved, with comparatively few strategies being implemented by different biochemical mechanisms in many organisms. Determining the strategy of a decision-making network provides a potentially powerful coarse-graining that links systems and evolutionary biology to understand biological design.},

Despite the widespread use of CDMY in fundamental and applied yeast research, the relation of their design and composition to the actual vitamin requirements of yeasts has not been subjected to critical review since their first development in the 1940s. Vitamins are formally defined as essential organic molecules that cannot be synthesized by an organism. In yeast physiology, use of the term ``vitamin'' is primarily based on essentiality for humans, but the genome of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae reference strain S288C harbours most of the structural genes required for synthesis of the vitamins included in popular CDMY. Here, we review the biochemistry and genetics of the biosynthesis of these compounds by S. cerevisiae and, based on a comparative genomics analysis, assess the diversity within the Saccharomyces genus with respect to vitamin prototrophy.},

  abstract = {Multiple biological processes are driven by oscillatory gene expression at different time scales. Pulsatile dynamics are thought to be widespread, and single-cell live imaging of gene expression has lead to a surge of dynamic, possibly oscillatory, data for different gene networks. However, the regulation of gene expression at the level of an individual cell involves reactions between finite numbers of molecules, and this can result in inherent randomness in expression dynamics, which blurs the boundaries between aperiodic fluctuations and noisy oscillators. This underlies a new challenge to the experimentalist because neither intuition nor pre-existing methods work well for identifying oscillatory activity in noisy biological time series. Thus, there is an acute need for an objective statistical method for classifying whether an experimentally derived noisy time series is periodic. Here, we present a new data analysis method that combines mechanistic stochastic modelling with the powerful methods of non-parametric regression with Gaussian processes. Our method can distinguish oscillatory gene expression from random fluctuations of non-oscillatory expression in single-cell time series, despite peak-to-peak variability in period and amplitude of single-cell oscillations. We show that our method outperforms the Lomb-Scargle periodogram in successfully classifying cells as oscillatory or non-oscillatory in data simulated from a simple genetic oscillator model and in experimental data. Analysis of bioluminescent live-cell imaging shows a significantly greater number of oscillatory cells when luciferase is driven by a Hes1 promoter (10/19), which has previously been reported to oscillate, than the constitutive MoMuLV 5' LTR (MMLV) promoter (0/25). The method can be applied to data from any gene network to both quantify the proportion of oscillating cells within a population and to measure the period and quality of oscillations. It is publicly available as a MATLAB package.},

Synchronization regions can be uncovered and also non-trivial network behavior can be foreseen via the reduced phase dynamics. Phase models have become an essential tool for describing and analyzing rhythmic neural activity. It is widely accepted that in oscillatory neural networks, phase synchronization is crucial for information processing and information routing. Accurately deriving the phase dynamics of interacting neural oscillators is far from trivial. We demonstrate how different reduction techniques of a network of interacting Wilson-Cowan neural masses can lead to different dynamics of the reduced networks of phase oscillators. We pinpoint caveats and sensitive issues in the derivation of the phase dynamics and show that an accurately derived phase model properly captures the collective dynamics. We finally investigate the influence of strong interactions and biologically plausible connectivity structures on the network behavior.},

In this work, we introduce a new representation that allows for matching of noisy, and unevenly-sampled trajectories, and we explore whether this representation may be used to characterise the state of health of a patient based on vital-sign data. We model the evolution of each vital-sign trajectory using multivariate Gaussian process regression, and we introduce a similarity measurement for the comparison of latent functions based on the local likelihood of the points in each trajectory. The similarity measurement is then used for recognising known trajectories and identifying unknown trajectories as would be required for identifying ``abnormal'' vital-sign time-series. We test our approach using a dataset that contains vital-sign observational data collected from a cohort of 154 patients who are recovering from gastrointestinal surgery. We show that our approach is able to discriminate between abnormal patient trajectories corresponding to those who deteriorated physiologically and were admitted to a higher level of care, from those belonging to patients who had no clinically relevant events.},

This variability in cellular behaviors can be essential for a small fraction of cells to adapt and survive in various environments. Analyses at the single-cell level have allowed to highlight the great variability that is present between cells within an isogenic population. Numerous molecular mechanisms have been uncovered, allowing to understand the emergence and the role of cellular heterogeneity. These attempts at identifying the source of cellular noise have also provided clues for strategies needed to control heterogeneity. In this review, S. cerevisiae is used as an example to illustrate the different factors leading to cell heterogeneity, ranging from intracellular processes to environmental constraints.

As a consequence, the use of standard estimation methods (such as gradient-based local ones) will often result in wrong solutions. Overfitting can be particularly problematic, since it produces very good calibrations, giving the impression of an excellent result. However, overfitted models exhibit poor predictive power.},

Trends are apparent in the ways that network topology constrains oscillator characteristics and dynamics. Also, noise and time delay within the network can both have constructive and destructive roles in generating oscillations, and stochastic coherence is commonplace. This review can be used to inform future work to design and implement new types of synthetic oscillators or to incorporate existing oscillators into new designs.},

Thus, a natural question is how transcriptional regulatory networks can robustly achieve accurate oscillation in the presence of biological noise. Here, we search all two- and three-node transcriptional regulatory network topologies for those robustly capable of accurate oscillation against the parameter variability (extrinsic noise) or stochasticity of chemical reactions (intrinsic noise). We find that, no matter what source of the noise is applied, the topologies containing the repressilator with positive autoregulation show higher robustness of accurate oscillation than those containing the activator-inhibitor oscillator, and additional positive autoregulation enhances the robustness against noise. Nevertheless, the attenuation of different sources of noise is governed by distinct mechanisms: the parameter variability is buffered by the long period, while the stochasticity of chemical reactions is filtered by the high amplitude. Furthermore, we analyze the noise of a synthetic human nuclear factor {$\kappa$}B (NF-{$\kappa$}B) signaling network by varying three different topologies and verify that the addition of a repressilator to the activator-inhibitor oscillator, which leads to the emergence of high-robustness motif\textemdash the repressilator with positive autoregulation\textemdash improves the oscillation accuracy in comparison to the topology with only an activator-inhibitor oscillator. These design principles may be applicable to other oscillatory circuits.},

However, the roles of Msn2/4 in primary metabolic pathways such as fatty acid {$\beta$}-oxidation are unclear. Here, in silico analysis revealed that the promoters of most genes involved in the biogenesis, function, and regulation of the peroxisome contain Msn2/4-binding sites. We also found that transcript levels of MSN2/MSN4 are increased in glucose-depletion conditions and that during growth in nonpreferred carbon sources, Msn2 is constantly localized to the nucleus in wild-type cells. Of note, the double mutant msn2{$\Delta$}msn4{$\Delta$} exhibited a severe growth defect when grown with oleic acid as the sole carbon source and had reduced transcript levels of major {$\beta$}-oxidation genes. ChIP indicated that Msn2 has increased occupancy on the promoters of {$\beta$}-oxidation genes in glucose-depleted conditions, and in vivo reporter gene analysis indicated reduced expression of these genes in msn2{$\Delta$}msn4{$\Delta$} cells. Moreover, mobility shift assays revealed that Msn4 binds {$\beta$}-oxidation gene promoters. Immunofluorescence microscopy with anti-peroxisome membrane protein antibodies disclosed that the msn2{$\Delta$}msn4{$\Delta$} strain had fewer peroxisomes than the wild type, and lipid analysis indicated that the msn2{$\Delta$}msn4{$\Delta$} strain had increased triacylglycerol and steryl ester levels. Collectively, our data suggest that Msn2/Msn4 transcription factors activate expression of the genes involved in fatty acid oxidation. Because glucose sensing, signaling, and fatty acid {$\beta$}-oxidation pathways are evolutionarily conserved throughout eukaryotes, the msn2{$\Delta$}msn4{$\Delta$} strain could therefore be a good model system for further study of these critical processes.},

One of the most widely explored applications of fluorescence spectroscopy is the detection of endoscopically invisible, early neoplastic growth in epithelial tissue sites. Currently, there are no effective diagnostic techniques for these early tissue transformations. If fluorescence spectroscopy can be applied successfully as a diagnostic technique in this clinical context, it may increase the potential for curative treatment, and thus, reduce complications and health care costs. Steady-state, fluorescence measurements from small tissue regions as well as relatively large tissue fields have been performed. To a much lesser extent, time-resolved, fluorescence measurements have also been explored for tissue characterization. Furthermore, sources of both intrinsic (endogenous fluorophores) and extrinsic fluorescence (exogenous fluorophores) have been considered. The goal of the current report is to provide a comprehensive review on steady-state and time-resolved, fluorescence measurements of neoplastic and non-neoplastic, biologic systems of varying degrees of complexity. First, the principles and methodology of fluorescence spectroscopy are discussed. Next, the endogenous fluorescence properties of cells, frozen tissue sections and excised and intact bulk tissues are presented; fluorescence measurements from both animal and human tissue models are discussed. This is concluded with future perspectives.},

FBA relies on an assumed metabolic objective for generating metabolic fluxes using GEMs. But, the most appropriate metabolic objective is not always obvious for a given condition and is likely context-specific, which often complicate the estimation of metabolic flux alterations between conditions. Here, we propose a new method, called {$\Delta$}FBA (deltaFBA), that integrates differential gene expression data to evaluate directly metabolic flux differences between two conditions. Notably, {$\Delta$}FBA does not require specifying the cellular objective. Rather, {$\Delta$}FBA seeks to maximize the consistency and minimize inconsistency between the predicted flux differences and differential gene expression. We showcased the performance of {$\Delta$}FBA through several case studies involving the prediction of metabolic alterations caused by genetic and environmental perturbations in Escherichia coli and caused by Type-2 diabetes in human muscle. Importantly, in comparison to existing methods, {$\Delta$}FBA gives a more accurate prediction of flux differences.},

Here, using a new approach that could be used for most of unicellular species, we show that the protein synthesis and cell size are interconnected biophysically and that protein synthesis may be the chief mechanism in establishing size limitations of unicellular organisms. This result is obtained based on the free energy balance equation of protein synthesis and the second law of thermodynamics. Our calculations show that protein synthesis involves a considerable amount of entropy reduction due to polymerization of amino acids depending on the cytoplasmic volume of the cell. The amount of entropy reduction will increase with cell growth and eventually makes the free energy variations of the protein synthesis positive (that is, forbidden thermodynamically). Within the limits of the second law of thermodynamics we propose a framework to estimate the optimal cell size at division.},

However, how {$\alpha$} and {$\beta$} cells coordinate via paracrine interaction to produce various Ca2+ oscillation patterns is still elusive. Using a microfluidic device and transgenic mice in which {$\alpha$} and {$\beta$} cells were labeled with different colors, we were able to record islet Ca2+ signals at single cell level for long times. Upon glucose stimulation, we observed heterogeneous Ca2+ oscillation patterns intrinsic to each islet. After a transient period, the oscillations of {$\alpha$} and {$\beta$} cells were globally phase-locked, i.e., the two types of cells in an islet each oscillate synchronously but with a phase shift between the two. While the activation of {$\alpha$} cells displayed a fixed time delay of \textasciitilde 20 s to that of {$\beta$} cells, {$\beta$} cells activated with a tunable delay after the {$\alpha$} cells. As a result, the tunable phase shift between {$\alpha$} and {$\beta$} cells set the islet oscillation period and pattern. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the phase shift can be modulated by glucagon. A mathematical model of islet Ca2+ oscillation taking into consideration of the paracrine interaction was constructed, which quantitatively agreed with the experimental data. Our study highlights the importance of cell-cell interaction to generate stable but tunable islet oscillation patterns.},

Peroxiredoxins, an antioxidant protein family, undergo rhythmic oxidation on the circadian time scale in a variety of species, including bacteria, insects and mammals, but also in red blood cells, a naturally occurring, non-transcriptional system.

  abstract = {The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a widely used eukaryotic model organism and a promising cell factory for industry. However, despite decades of research, the regulation of its metabolism is not yet fully understood, and its complexity represents a major challenge for engineering and optimising biosynthetic routes. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of resource and proteomic allocation data in enhancing models for metabolic processes. However, comprehensive and accurate proteome dynamics data that can be used for such approaches are still very limited. Therefore, we performed a quantitative proteome dynamics study to comprehensively cover the transition from exponential to stationary phase for both aerobically and anaerobically grown yeast cells. The combination of highly controlled reactor experiments, biological replicates and standardised sample preparation procedures ensured reproducibility and accuracy. Additionally, we selected the CEN.PK lineage for our experiments because of its relevance for both fundamental and applied research. Together with the prototrophic, standard haploid strain CEN.PK113-7D, we also investigated an engineered strain with genetic minimisation of the glycolytic pathway, resulting in the quantitative assessment of over 1700 proteins across 54 proteomes. These proteins account for nearly 40\% of the overall yeast proteome and approximately 99\% of the total protein biomass. The anaerobic cultures showed remarkably less proteome-level changes compared to the aerobic cultures, during transition from the exponential to the stationary phase as a consequence of the lack of the diauxic shift in the absence of oxygen. These results support the notion that anaerobically growing cells lack time and resources to adapt to changes in the environment. This proteome dynamics study constitutes an important step towards better understanding of the impact of glucose exhaustion and oxygen on the complex proteome allocation process in yeast. Finally, the established proteome dynamics data provide a valuable resource for the development of resource allocation models as well as for metabolic engineering efforts.},

  abstract = {Circadian rhythms provide daily temporal structure to cellular and organismal biological processes, ranging from gene expression to cognition. Higher-frequency (intradaily) ultradian rhythms are similarly ubiquitous but have garnered far less empirical study, in part because of the properties that define them?multimodal periods, non-stationarity, circadian harmonics, and diurnal modulation?pose challenges to their accurate and precise quantification. Wavelet analyses are ideally suited to address these challenges, but wavelet-based measurement of ultradian rhythms has remained largely idiographic. Here, we describe novel analytical approaches, based on discrete and continuous wavelet transforms, which permit quantification of rhythmic power distribution across a broad ultradian spectrum, as well as precise identification of period within empirically determined ultradian bands. Moreover, the aggregation of normalized wavelet matrices allows group-level analyses of experimental treatments, thereby circumventing limitations of idiographic approaches. The accuracy and precision of these wavelet analyses were validated using in silico and in vivo models with known ultradian features. Experiments in male and female mice yielded robust and repeatable measures of ultradian period and power in home cage locomotor activity, confirming and extending reports of ultradian rhythm modulation by sex, gonadal hormones, and circadian entrainment. Seasonal changes in day length modulated ultradian period and power, and exerted opposite effects in the light and dark phases of the 24?h day, underscoring the importance of evaluating ultradian rhythms with attention to circadian phase. Sex differences in ultradian rhythms were more prominent at night and depended on gonadal hormones in male mice. Thus, relatively straightforward modifications to the wavelet procedure allowed quantification of ultradian rhythms with appropriate time-frequency resolution, generating accurate, and repeatable measures of period and power which are suitable for group-level analyses. These analytical tools may afford deeper understanding of how ultradian rhythms are generated and respond to interoceptive and exteroceptive cues.},

However, using the yeast respiratory oscillation (YRO) as a sensitive measurement of metabolism, we find that non-UV visible light has a significant impact on yeast metabolism. Blue/green wavelengths of visible light shorten the period and dampen the amplitude of the YRO, which is an ultradian rhythm of cell metabolism and transcription. The wavelengths of light that have the greatest effect coincide with the peak absorption regions of cytochromes. Moreover, treating yeast with the electron transport inhibitor sodium azide has similar effects on the YRO as visible light. Because impairment of respiration by light would change several state variables believed to play vital roles in the YRO (e.g., oxygen tension and ATP levels), we tested oxygen's role in YRO stability and found that externally induced oxygen depletion can reset the phase of the oscillation, demonstrating that respiratory capacity plays a role in the oscillation's period and phase. Light-induced damage to the cytochromes also produces reactive oxygen species that up-regulate the oxidative stress response gene TRX2 that is involved in pathways that enable sustained growth in bright visible light. Therefore, visible light can modulate cellular rhythmicity and metabolism through unexpectedly photosensitive pathways.},

Dysregulation of this process can lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation and genomic instability, both which are hallmarks of cancer. Cell cycle progression is dictated by a complex network of kinases and phosphatases. These enzymes act on their substrates in a highly specific temporal manner ensuring that the process of cell division is unidirectional and irreversible. Key events of the cell cycle, such as duplication of genetic material and its redistribution to daughter cells, occur in S-phase and mitosis, respectively. Deciphering the dynamics of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events during these cell cycle phases is important. Here, we showcase a quantitative proteomic and phosphoproteomic mass spectrometry dataset that profiles both early and late phosphorylation events and associated proteome alterations that occur during S-phase and mitotic arrest in the model organism S. cerevisiae. This dataset is of broad interest as the molecular mechanisms governing cell cycle progression are conserved throughout evolution.

Sporting alternatives include pulling out most of the team's first string players, or calling plays designed to run out the clock (e.g., in American football, kneeling or running the ball up the middle). The term and the concept are not common elsewhere in the world. Mercy rules are used in many amateur sports, which end the game when the score reaches a certain point. The most common negative consequences of running up the score are injuries to a game's starting players, lack of experience for the non-starting players on the team (in those cases where starters are left in a game well after the outcome is certain), and motivating future opposing teams. Players on the losing side who feel disrespected may decide to vent their frustration through violent or unsporting play, which can lead to injuries and fights, and even post-game punishment such as fines or suspension from future play. Some have advocated in favor of running up the score using arguments which include catering to polls, getting additional experience, and to prevent comebacks. Running up the score is considered poor sportsmanship by many fans, players, and coaches but with different opinions how big an insult it is. Allegations of poor sportsmanship are often brought up soon after a team scores multiple times near the end of a one-sided match.},

Thus, at the wild-type level of enzyme IIGlc activity, the control coefficient of this enzyme on the growth rate on glucose and on the rate of glucose oxidation was low, while the control coefficient on uptake and phosphorylation of methyl alpha-glucopyranoside (an enzyme IIGlc-specific, nonmetabolizable glucose analog) was relatively high (0.55 to 0.65).

  abstract = {To understand microbial growth with mathematical models has a long tradition that dates back to the pioneering work of Jacques Monod in the 1940s. Growth laws are simple mathematical expressions that aim at describing growth rates of microbes as functions of external parameters, in particular nutrient concentrations. These laws are now widely applied to construct, e.g., dynamic ecosystem models. However, to explain the growth laws from underlying (first) principles is extremely challenging. In the second half of the 20th century, numerous experimental approaches aimed at precisely measuring heat production during microbial growth to determine the entropy balance in a growing cell and to quantify the exported entropy. This has led to the development of thermodynamic theories of microbial growth, which have generated fundamental understanding and identified principle limitations of the growth process. Whereas these approaches considered a growing microbe as a black box, modern theories heavily rely on genomic resources to describe and model genome-scale networks to explain microbial growth. Interestingly, however, thermodynamic constraints are often included in modern modelling approaches only in a rather superficial fashion, and it appears that recent modelling approaches and classical theories are disconnected fields. In order to stimulate a closer interaction between these fields, we here review various theoretical approaches that aim at describing microbial growth based on thermodynamic principles. We start with classical black-box models of cellular growth, and continue with genome-scale modelling approaches that include thermodynamics, before we place these models in the context of fundamental considerations based on non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. We conclude by identifying conceptual overlaps between the fields and suggest how the various types of theories and models can be integrated. We outline how concepts from one approach may help to inform or constrain another, and we demonstrate how genome-scale models can be used to infer classical black-box parameters, which are experimentally accessible in growth experiments. Such integration will allow understanding to what extent microbes can be viewed as thermodynamic machines, and how close they operate to theoretical optima.},

  abstract = {Detecting oscillations in time series datasets remains a challenging problem even after decades of research. Development of improved statistical algorithms, therefore, remains an exciting avenue of research, especially in fields such as chronobiology where gene expression oscillations tend to be low amplitude, noisy and non-stationary. Here we introduce a new method, ODeGP (Oscillation Detection using Gaussian Processes), which combines Gaussian Process (GP) regression with Bayesian inference to provide a flexible approach to the problem. Besides naturally incorporating measurement errors and non-uniformly sampled data, ODeGP uses a recently developed kernel to improve the detection of non-stationary waveforms. An additional advantage is that it circumvents issues related to p-value based rhythmicity classification by using the Bayes factor instead. Using a variety of synthetic datasets we first demonstrate that ODeGP almost always outperforms eight commonly used methods in detecting stationary as well as nonstationary oscillations. Next, by analyzing existing qPCR datasets with known (non)oscillatory behavior, we find that the ODeGP Bayes factors show a large separation between oscillatory and non-oscillatory datasets, providing a good metric for the classification problem. In qPCR datasets that exhibit low amplitude and noisy oscillations, we demonstrate that our method is more sensitive compared to the existing methods at detecting weak oscillations. Finally, we generate new qPCR time-series datasets on pluripotent mouse embryonic stem cells, which are expected to exhibit no oscillations of the core circadian clock genes. Surprisingly, we discover using ODeGP that increasing cell density can result in the generation of oscillations in the Bmal1 gene, thus highlighting our method's ability to discover new and unexpected patterns. We make ODeGP available for open-source use as an easy to run R-package.},

Alterations in energy availability trigger cell-cycle checkpoints, suggesting a bidirectional connection between cell division and general metabolism.

We briefly present two resources for the study of circadian omic (e.g. transcriptomic, metabolomic, proteomic) time series. First, BIO\_CYCLE is a deep-learning-based program and web server that can analyze omic time series and statistically assess their periodic nature and, when periodic, accurately infer the corresponding period, amplitude, and phase. Second, CircadiOmics is the larges annotated repository of circadian omic time series, containing over 260 experiments and 90 million individual measurements, across multiple organs and tissues, and across 9 different species. In combination, these tools enable powerful bioinformatics and systems biology analyses. The are currently being deployed in a host of different projects where they are enabling significant discoveries: both tools are publicly available over the web at: http://circadiomics.ics.uci.edu/.},

  abstract = {Abstract Genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) are widely used to calculate metabolic phenotypes. They rely on defining a set of constraints, the most common of which is that the production of metabolites and/or growth are limited by the carbon source uptake rate. However, enzyme abundances and kinetics, which act as limitations on metabolic fluxes, are not taken into account. Here, we present GECKO, a method that enhances a GEM to account for enzymes as part of reactions, thereby ensuring that each metabolic flux does not exceed its maximum capacity, equal to the product of the enzyme's abundance and turnover number. We applied GECKO to a Saccharomyces cerevisiae GEM and demonstrated that the new model could correctly describe phenotypes that the previous model could not, particularly under high enzymatic pressure conditions, such as yeast growing on different carbon sources in excess, coping with stress, or overexpressing a specific pathway. GECKO also allows to directly integrate quantitative proteomics data; by doing so, we significantly reduced flux variability of the model, in over 60\% of metabolic reactions. Additionally, the model gives insight into the distribution of enzyme usage between and within metabolic pathways. The developed method and model are expected to increase the use of model-based design in metabolic engineering.},

  abstract = {Stochastic processes in cells are associated with fluctuations in mRNA1, protein production and degradation2,3, noisy partition of cellular components at division4, and other cell processes. Variability within a clonal population of cells originates from such stochastic processes, which may be amplified or reduced by deterministic factors5. Cell-to-cell variability, such as that seen in the heterogeneous response of bacteria to antibiotics, or of cancer cells to treatment, is understood as the inevitable consequence of stochasticity. Variability in cell-cycle duration was observed long ago; however, its sources are still unknown. A central question is whether the variance of the observed distribution originates from stochastic processes, or whether it arises mostly from a deterministic process that only appears to be random. A surprising feature of cell-cycle-duration inheritance is that it seems to be lost within one generation but to be still present in the next generation, generating poor correlation between mother and daughter cells but high correlation between cousin cells6. This observation suggests the existence of underlying deterministic factors that determine the main part of cell-to-cell variability. We developed an experimental system that precisely measures the cell-cycle duration of thousands of mammalian cells along several generations and a mathematical framework that allows discrimination between stochastic and deterministic processes in lineages of cells. We show that the inter- and intra-generation correlations reveal complex inheritance of the cell-cycle duration. Finally, we build a deterministic nonlinear toy model for cell-cycle inheritance that reproduces the main features of our data. Our approach constitutes a general method to identify deterministic variability in lineages of cells or organisms, which may help to predict and, eventually, reduce cell-to-cell heterogeneity in various systems, such as cancer cells under treatment.},

  abstract = {All previous studies on the yeast metabolome have yielded a plethora of information on the components, function and organisation of low molecular mass and macromolecular components involved in the cellular metabolic network. Here we emphasise that an understanding of the global dynamics of the metabolome in vivo requires elucidation of the temporal dynamics of metabolic processes on many time-scales. We illustrate this using the 40 min oscillation in respiratory activity displayed in auto-synchronous continuously grown cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where respiration cycles between a phase of increased respiration (oxidative phase) and decreased respiration (reductive phase). Thereby an ultradian clock, i.e. a timekeeping device that runs through many cycles during one day, is involved in the co-ordination of the vast majority of events and processes in yeast. Through continuous online measurements, we first show that mitochondrial and redox physiology are intertwined to produce the temporal landscape on which cellular events occur. Next we look at the higher order processes of DNA duplication and mitochondrial structure to reveal that both events are choreographed during the respiratory cycles. Furthermore, spectral analysis using the discrete Fourier transformation of high-resolution (10 Hz) time-series of NAD(P)H confirms the existence of higher frequency components of biological origin and that these follow a scale-free architecture even in stable oscillating modes. A different signal-processing approach using discrete wavelet transformations (DWT) indicates that there is a significant contribution to the overall signal from {$\sim$} 5, {$\sim$} 10 and {$\sim$} 20-minutes cycles and the amplitudes of these cycles are phase-dependent. Further investigation (derivative of Gaussian continuous wavelet transformation) reveals that the observed 20-minutes cycles are actually confined to the reductive phase and consist of two {$\sim$} 15-minutes cycles. Moreover, the 5 and 10-minutes cycles are restricted to the oxidative phase of the cycle. The mitochondrial origin of these signals was confirmed by pulse-injection of the cytochrome c oxidase inhibitor H2S. We next discuss how these multi-oscillatory states can impinge on the apparently complex reactome (represented as a phase diagram of 1,650 chemical species that show oscillatory behaviour). We conclude that biological processes can be considerably more comprehensible when dynamic in vivo time-structure is taken into account.},

In this study, the enzymatic properties of squalene epoxidase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae were examined. Unlike Candida squalene epoxidase, S. cerevisiae squalene epoxidase required NADPH for enzyme reaction. However, S. cerevisiae enzyme reaction did not require FAD or autologous S105 fraction. Unlike rat squalene epoxidase, the activity of S. cerevisiae was reduced by Triton X-100, a nonionic detergent. Terbinafine, an inhibitor of fungal squalene epoxidase, inhibited the enzyme in a non-competitive manner, while NB-598, an inhibitor of mammalian squalene epoxidase, barely inhibited it in a partially non-competitive manner. Thus, the properties of squalene epoxidase from S. cerevisiae were different from those of squalene epoxidase from rats and Candida, which were previously known. We propose that a species difference of squalene epoxidase exists not only between animals and fungi but between Candida and Saccharomyces.},

This paper does not introduce a new detection technique, but instead studies the reliability and efficiency of detection with the most commonly used technique, the periodogram, in the case where the observation times are unevenly spaced. This choice was made because, of the methods in current use, it appears to have the simplest statistical behavior. A modification of the classical definition of the periodogram is necessary in order to retain the simple statistical behavior of the evenly spaced case. With this modification, periodogram analysis and least-squares fitting of sine waves to the data are exactly equivalent. Certain difficulties with the use of the periodogram are less important than commonly believed in the case of detection of strictly periodic signals. In addition, the standard method for mitigating these difficulties (tapering) can be used just as well if the sampling is uneven. An analysis of the statistical significance of signal detections is presented, with examples},

Here, we used super-resolution single-molecule microscopy to obtain biophysical characteristics of individual aggregates of a model misfolded protein {$\increment$}ssCPY* labelled with GFP. We demonstrated that oxidative and hyperosmotic stress lead to increased aggregate stoichiometries but not necessarily the total number of aggregates. Moreover, our data suggest the importance of the thioredoxin peroxidase Tsa1 for the controlled sequestering and clearance of aggregates upon both conditions. Our work provides novel insights into the understanding of the cellular response to stress via revealing the dynamical properties of stress-induced protein aggregates.},

While details of this metabolic network are well established, knowledge of the superordinate regulatory design principles is limited. Here, we investigated by iterative wet lab and modeling experiments the resource allocation process during the larval development of Drosophila melanogaster. We chose this system, as survival of the animals depends on the successful allocation of their available resources to the conflicting processes of growth and storage metabolite deposition. First, we generated ``FlySilico'', a curated metabolic network of Drosophila, and performed time-resolved growth and metabolite measurements with larvae raised on a holidic diet. Subsequently, we performed flux balance analysis simulations and tested the predictive power of our model by simulating the impact of diet alterations on growth and metabolism. Our predictions correctly identified the essential amino acids as growth limiting factor, and metabolic flux differences in agreement with our experimental data. Thus, we present a framework to study important questions of resource allocation in a multicellular organism including process priorization and optimality principles.},

Experimentally, these fluxes can be measured by 13C-flux analysis, and there has been a long-standing interest in understanding this functional network operation from an evolutionary perspective. On the basis of 13C-determined fluxes from nine bacteria and multi-objective optimization theory, we show that metabolism operates close to the Pareto-optimal surface of a three-dimensional space defined by competing objectives. Consistent with flux data from evolved Escherichia coli, we propose that flux states evolve under the trade-off between two principles: optimality under one given condition and minimal adjustment between conditions. These principles form the forces by which evolution shapes metabolic fluxes in microorganisms' environmental context.},

  abstract = {Cells must continuously adapt to changing environments and, thus, have evolved mechanisms allowing them to respond to repeated stimuli. For example, faster gene induction upon a repeated stimulus aids adaptation - a process known as reinduction memory. However, whether such a memory exists for gene repression is unclear. Here, we studied gene repression across repeated carbon source shifts in over 2,500 single Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. By monitoring the expression of a carbon source-responsive gene, galactokinase 1 (Gal1), and mathematical modeling, we discovered repression memory at the population and single-cell level. Using a repressor model to estimate single-cell repression parameters, we show that repression memory is due to a shortened repression delay, the estimated time gap between carbon source shift and Gal1 expression termination, upon the repeated carbon source shift. Additionally, we show that cells lacking Elp6 display a gain-of-repression-memory phenotype characterized by a stronger decrease in repression delay between two consecutive carbon source shifts. Collectively, our study provides the first quantitative description of repression memory in single cells.},

  abstract = {SummaryUsing a continuous flow technique the relationship between growth rate and substrate concentration was investigated with glucose as the limiting factor of a culture of Escherichia coli. Graphical and numerical analysis of the experimental data demonstrated that the application of the Michaelis-Menten equation produced erroneous results, whereas, the constants obtained from the Teissier equation were in agreement with the experimental data. On this basis, new equations defining the steady state cell and substrate concentration in continuous flow cultures were developed and tested against experimental data.Comparison of the specific growth rates, substrate uptake rates and oxygen consumption rates demonstrated that all were directly proportional to each other and could be related to each other by mathematical equations. Specifically it was shown that as the growth rate increased from 0.06 to k m =0.76 the substrate uptake rate increased from 134 to 1420 mg glucose per gram cell weight per hour and the oxygen consumption rate increased from 48.6 to 505 mg O2 per gram cell weight per hour. Independent of the growth rate 37\% of the carbohydrate consumed were oxidized. The yield factor varied from 0.44 at low growth rates to 0.54 at high growth rates. Analysis of the growth rate-substrate uptake rate relationship indicated that a minimum substrate uptake rate of 55 mg glucose per gram cell weight per hour existed below which cell reproduction would cease. This was supported by the fact that steady state conditions could not be maintained in the culture at D values below 0.02 when the substrate supply rate decreased below 45 mg glucose per gram cell weight per hour.},

A theory incorporating these constraints can accurately predict how cell proliferation and gene expression affect one another, quantitatively accounting for the effect of translation-inhibiting antibiotics on gene expression and the effect of gratuitous protein expression on cell growth. The use of such empirical relations, analogous to phenomenological laws, may facilitate our understanding and manipulation of complex biological systems before underlying regulatory circuits are elucidated.

Yeast has only a slightly greater genetic complexity than bacteria and shares many of the technical advantages that permitted rapid progress in the molecular genetics of prokaryotes and their viruses. Some of the properties that make yeast particularly suitable for biological studies include rapid growth, dispersed cells, the ease of replica plating and mutant isolation, a well-defined genetic system, and most important, a highly versatile DNA transformation system. Being nonpathogenic, yeast can be handled with little precautions. Large quantities of normal baker's yeast are commercially available and can provide a cheap source for biochemical studies. The development of DNA transformation has made yeast particularly accessible to gene cloning and genetic engineering techniques. Structural genes corresponding to virtually any genetic trait can be identified by complementation from plasmid libraries. Plasmids can be introduced into yeast cells either as replicating molecules or by integration into the genome. In contrast to most other organisms, integrative recombination of transforming DNA in yeast proceeds exclusively via homologous recombination. Cloned yeast sequences, accompanied by foreign sequences on plasmids, can therefore be directed at will to specific locations in the genome.},

Many aspects of the quiescence program as well as the mechanisms governing the entry and exit from quiescence remain poorly understood. Previous studies using the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have shown that upon entry into stationary phase, a quiescent cell population emerges that is heavier in density than nonquiescent cells. Here, we show that total intracellular trehalose and glycogen content exhibits substantial correlation with the density of individual cells both in stationary phase batch cultures and during continuous growth. During prolonged quiescence, trehalose stores are often maintained in favor over glycogen, perhaps to fulfill its numerous stress-protectant functions. Immediately upon exit from quiescence, cells preferentially metabolize trehalose over other fuel sources. Moreover, cells lacking trehalose initiate growth more slowly and frequently exhibit poor survivability. Together, our results support the view that trehalose, which is more stable than other carbohydrates, provides an enduring source of energy that helps drive cell cycle progression upon return to growth.},

  abstract = {Oscillations in patterns of expression of a large fraction of yeast genes are associated with the ``metabolic cycle,'' usually seen only in prestarved, continuous cultures of yeast. We used FISH of mRNA in individual cells to test the hypothesis that these oscillations happen in single cells drawn from unsynchronized cultures growing exponentially in chemostats. Gene-expression data from synchronized cultures were used to predict coincident appearance of mRNAs from pairs of genes in the unsynchronized cells. Quantitative analysis of the FISH results shows that individual unsynchronized cells growing slowly because of glucose limitation or phosphate limitation show the predicted oscillations. We conclude that the yeast metabolic cycle is an intrinsic property of yeast metabolism and does not depend on either synchronization or external limitation of growth by the carbon source.},

During fatty acid synthesis, the growing fatty acid chain is thought to be shuttled by~the dynamic acyl carrier protein domain to several enzyme active sites.

The {$\gamma$} subunit spans the length of the FAS inner cavity, impeding reductase activities of FAS, regulating NADPH turnover by kinetic hysteresis at the ketoreductase, and suppressing off-pathway reactions at the enoylreductase. The {$\gamma$} subunit delineates the functional compartment within FAS. As a scaffold, it may be exploited to incorporate natural and designed enzymatic activities that are not present in natural FAS.},

  abstract = {Genome-scale metabolic models (GSMs) provide a comprehensive representation of cellular metabolism. GSMs provide a mechanistic link between cellular genotypes and metabolic phenotypes, and are thus widely used to analyze metabolism at the systems level. GSMs consist of hundreds or thousands of reactions. They have thus largely been analyzed with computationally efficient constraint-based methods such as flux-balance analysis, limiting their scope and phenotype prediction accuracy. Computationally more demanding but potentially more informative methods, such as kinetic and dynamic modeling, are currently limited to small or medium-sized models. Thus, it is desirable to achieve unbiased stoichiometric reductions of large-scale metabolic models to small, coarse-grained model representations that capture significant metabolic modules. Here, we review published automated and semiautomated methods used for large-scale metabolic model reduction. The top-down methods discussed provide minimal networks that retain a set of user-protected phenotypes, but may reduce the model's metabolic and phenotypic versatility. In contrast, the two bottom-up approaches reviewed retain a more unbiased set of phenotypes; at the same time, these methods require the partitioning of the GSM into metabolic subsystems by the user, and make strong assumptions on the subsystems' connections and their states, respectively.},

Analysis of these data, together with data from studies where glucose was the carbon source, allowed us to distinguish a ``universal'' growth rate response (GRR) common to all media studied from a GRR specific to the carbon source. Genes with positive universal GRR include ribosomal, translation, and mitochondrial genes, and those with negative GRR include autophagy, vacuolar, and stress response genes. The carbon source\textendash specific GRR genes control mitochondrial function, peroxisomes, and synthesis of vitamins and cofactors, suggesting this response may reflect the intensity of oxidative metabolism. All genes with universal GRR, which comprise 25\% of the genome, are expressed periodically in the yeast metabolic cycle (YMC). We propose that the universal GRR may be accounted for by changes in the relative durations of the YMC phases. This idea is supported by oxygen consumption data from metabolically synchronized cultures with doubling times ranging from 5 to 14 h. We found that the high oxygen consumption phase of the YMC can coincide exactly with the S phase of the cell division cycle, suggesting that oxidative metabolism and DNA replication are not incompatible.},

We discovered that a prototrophic batch culture of budding yeast, growing in a phosphate-limited ethanol medium, synchronizes spontaneously and goes through multiple metabolic cycles, whereas the fraction of cells in the G1/G0 phase of the CDC increases monotonically from 90 to 99\%. This demonstrates that metabolic cycling does not require cell division cycling and that metabolic synchrony does not require carbon-source limitation. More than 3,000 genes, including most genes annotated to the CDC, were expressed periodically in our batch culture, albeit a mere 10\% of the cells divided asynchronously; only a smaller subset of CDC genes correlated with cell division. These results suggest that the yeast metabolic cycle reflects a growth cycle during G1/G0 and explains our previous puzzling observation that genes annotated to the CDC increase in expression at slow growth.},

  abstract = {Cellular senescence is a stress response characterised by a permanent cell cycle arrest and a proinflammatory secretome. In addition to its tumour suppressor role, senescence is involved in ageing and promotes many disease processes such as cancer, type 2 diabetes, osteoarthritis, and SARS-CoV-2 infection. There is a growing interest in therapies based on targeted elimination of senescent cells, yet so far only a few such senolytics are known, partly due to the poor grasp of the molecular mechanisms that control the senescence survival programme. Here we report a highly effective machine learning pipeline for the discovery of senolytic compounds. Using solely published data, we trained machine learning algorithms to classify compounds according to their senolytic action. Models were trained on as few as 58 known senolytics against a background of FDA-approved compounds or in late-stage clinical development (2,523 in total). We computationally screened various chemical libraries and singled out top candidates for validation in human lung fibroblasts (IMR90) and lung adenocarcinoma (A549) cell lines. This led to the discovery of three novel senolytics: ginkgetin, oleandrin and periplocin, with potency comparable to current senolytics and a several hundred-fold reduction in experimental screening costs. Our work demonstrates that machine learning can take maximum advantage of existing drug screening data, paving the way for new open science approaches to drug discovery for senescence-associated diseases.},

One fairly recently discovered role of CDKs is the coordination of carbon and energy metabolism with proliferation. Evidence from different model organisms is accumulating that CDKs can directly and indirectly control fluxes through metabolism, for example by phosphorylating metabolic enzymes. In this mini-review, we summarize the emerging role of CDKs in regulating carbon and energy metabolism and discuss examples in different models from yeast to cancer cells.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: This article presents libRoadRunner, an extensible, high-performance, cross-platform, open-source software library for the simulation and analysis of models expressed using Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML). SBML is the most widely used standard for representing dynamic networks, especially biochemical networks. libRoadRunner is fast enough to support large-scale problems such as tissue models, studies that require large numbers of repeated runs and interactive simulations. RESULTS: libRoadRunner is a self-contained library, able to run both as a component inside other tools via its C++ and C bindings, and interactively through its Python interface. Its Python Application Programming Interface (API) is similar to the APIs of MATLAB ( WWWMATHWORKSCOM: ) and SciPy ( HTTP//WWWSCIPYORG/: ), making it fast and easy to learn. libRoadRunner uses a custom Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler built on the widely used LLVM JIT compiler framework. It compiles SBML-specified models directly into native machine code for a variety of processors, making it appropriate for solving extremely large models or repeated runs. libRoadRunner is flexible, supporting the bulk of the SBML specification (except for delay and non-linear algebraic equations) including several SBML extensions (composition and distributions). It offers multiple deterministic and stochastic integrators, as well as tools for steady-state analysis, stability analysis and structural analysis of the stoichiometric matrix. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: libRoadRunner binary distributions are available for Mac OS X, Linux and Windows. The library is licensed under Apache License Version 2.0. libRoadRunner is also available for ARM-based computers such as the Raspberry Pi. http://www.libroadrunner.org provides online documentation, full build instructions, binaries and a git source repository.

For cell viability, and to maintain volume within narrow limits, the daily variation in osmotic potential exerted by changes in the soluble proteome must be counterbalanced. The mechanisms and consequences of this osmotic compensation have not been investigated before. In cultured cells and in tissue we find that compensation involves electroneutral active transport of Na+, K+, and Cl- through differential activity of SLC12A family cotransporters. In cardiomyocytes ex vivo and in vivo, compensatory ion fluxes confer daily variation in electrical activity. Perturbation of soluble protein abundance has commensurate effects on ion composition and cellular function across the circadian cycle. Thus, circadian regulation of the proteome impacts ion homeostasis with substantial consequences for the physiology of electrically active cells such as cardiomyocytes.},

A prevailing paradigm suggests that timing information flows linearly from rhythmic transcription via protein abundance changes to drive circadian regulation of cellular function. Challenging this view, recent evidence indicates daily variation in many cellular functions arises through rhythmic post-translational regulation of protein activity. We suggest cellular circadian timing primarily functions to maintain proteome homeostasis rather than perturb it. Indeed, although relevant to timekeeping mechanism, daily rhythms of clock protein abundance may be the exception, not the rule. Informed by insights from yeast and mammalian models, we propose that optimal bioenergetic efficiency results from coupled rhythms in mammalian target of rapamycin complex activity, protein synthesis/turnover, ion transport~and protein sequestration, which drive facilitatory rhythms in metabolic flux and substrate utilisation. Such daily consolidation of proteome renewal would account for many aspects of circadian cell biology~whilst maintaining osmotic homeostasis.},

  abstract = {Cell-cycle checkpoints and DNA repair processes protect organisms from potentially lethal mutational damage. Compared to other budding yeasts in the subphylum Saccharomycotina, we noticed that a lineage in the genus Hanseniaspora exhibited very high evolutionary rates, low Guanine\textendash Cytosine (GC) content, small genome sizes, and lower gene numbers. To better understand Hanseniaspora evolution, we analyzed 25 genomes, including 11 newly sequenced, representing 18/21 known species in the genus. Our phylogenomic analyses identify two Hanseniaspora lineages, a faster-evolving lineage (FEL), which began diversifying approximately 87 million years ago (mya), and a slower-evolving lineage (SEL), which began diversifying approximately 54 mya. Remarkably, both lineages lost genes associated with the cell cycle and genome integrity, but these losses were greater in the FEL. E.g., all species lost the cell-cycle regulator WHIskey 5 (WHI5), and the FEL lost components of the spindle checkpoint pathway (e.g., Mitotic Arrest-Deficient 1 [MAD1], Mitotic Arrest-Deficient 2 [MAD2]) and DNA-damage\textendash checkpoint pathway (e.g., Mitosis Entry Checkpoint 3 [MEC3], RADiation sensitive 9 [RAD9]). Similarly, both lineages lost genes involved in DNA repair pathways, including the DNA glycosylase gene 3-MethylAdenine DNA Glycosylase 1 (MAG1), which is part of the base-excision repair pathway, and the DNA photolyase gene PHotoreactivation Repair deficient 1 (PHR1), which is involved in pyrimidine dimer repair. Strikingly, the FEL lost 33 additional genes, including polymerases (i.e., POLymerase 4 [POL4] and POL32) and telomere-associated genes (e.g., Repressor/activator site binding protein-Interacting Factor 1 [RIF1], Replication Factor A 3 [RFA3], Cell Division Cycle 13 [CDC13], Pbp1p Binding Protein [PBP2]). Echoing these losses, molecular evolutionary analyses reveal that, compared to the SEL, the FEL stem lineage underwent a burst of accelerated evolution, which resulted in greater mutational loads, homopolymer instabilities, and higher fractions of mutations associated with the common endogenously damaged base, 8-oxoguanine. We conclude that Hanseniaspora is an ancient lineage that has diversified and thrived, despite lacking many otherwise highly conserved cell-cycle and genome integrity genes and pathways, and may represent a novel, to our knowledge, system for studying cellular life without them.},

The problem is challenging, because the origin of the time variability is usually unknown. In mathematical terms, the oscillations are non-autonomous, reflecting the physics of open systems where the function of each oscillator is affected by its environment. Time-frequency analysis being essential, recent advances in this area, including wavelet phase coherence analysis and nonlinear mode decomposition, are discussed. Some applications to biology and physiology are described. Although the most important manifestation of time-variable oscillations is arguably in biology, they also crop up in, e.g. astrophysics, or for electrons on superfluid helium. The book brings together the research of the best international experts in seemingly very different disciplinary areas},

However, regarding some network components, such as the transcriptional regulators STB1 and WHI5, only few orthologs exist which are confined to individual Saccharomycotina species. While Whi5 has been characterized as yeast analog of human Rb protein, in the particular case of Stb1 (Sin three binding protein 1) identification of functional analogs emerges as difficult because to date its exact functionality still remains obscured. By aiming to resolve Stb1\textasciiacute s enigmatic role this Perspectives article especially surveys works covering relations between Cyclin/CDKs, the heteromeric transcription factor complexes SBF (Swi4/Swi6) and MBF (Mbp1/Swi6), as well as additional coregulators (Whi5, Sin3, Rpd3, Nrm1) which are collectively associated with the orderly transcription at `Start' of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell cycle. In this context, interaction capacities of the Sin3-scaffold protein are widely surveyed because its four PAH domains (Paired Amphiphatic Helix) represent a `recruitment-code' for gene-specific targeting of repressive histone deacetylase activity (Rpd3) via different transcription factors. Here Stb1 plays a role in Sin3\textasciiacute s action on transcription at the G1/S-boundary. Through bioinformatic analyses a potential Sin3-interaction domain (SID) was detected in Stb1, and beyond that, connections within the G1/S-regulatory network are discussed in structural and evolutionary context thereby providing conceptual perspectives.},

  abstract = {Unlike cells in a multicellular organism, free living microbes are subject to abrupt changes in environment that can come with no warning. Cells must be prepared to react to these changes on timescales too short for them to change their composition and thus must have mechanisms in place to maintain homeostasis until they can reach a new steady-state. One particularly dangerous transition is the reintroduction to rich carbon sources. In the case of the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the reintroduction to a glucose-rich environment after a period of starvation can result in death; cells can over invest energy in the first steps of glycolysis before they begin to receive returns on this investment. In our investigation of this phenomenon, we have found that one mechanism in place to prevent overinvestment is the polymerization of the glucokinase, Glk1, which catalyzes the first step in glycolysis. Glk1 is a structural homolog of actin, one of the best studied polymer forming proteins, however, that the polymerization of these two proteins has arisen independently. Glk1 polymerization appears to have arisen in the last common ancestor of a group of yeast that existed approximately 150 million years ago. I have found that Glk1 polymerization inhibits Glk1 enzyme activity. Structural studies of the Glk1 protein and Glk1 filaments have allowed us to design a mutant that cannot polymerize and thus lacks the concentration- dependent inhibition of Glk1 enzyme activity. I have leveraged this mutant to demonstrate that without Glk1 polymerization, cells die more frequently when they are refed glucose and that these cells show additional defects growing on sugars. Thus, the polymerization of Glk1 is important for yeast cells ability to respond to unexpected increases in the concentration of glucose.},

Actuating of the outer valve with integrated opening results in a partial isolation in a volume of 11.8 nL, i.e. the cell surrounding fluid can be exchanged diffusion-based without causing shear stress or cell loss. Actuation of the inner ring-shaped valve isolates the trapped cell completely in a small analysis volume of 230 pL. The device was used to determine the growth rate of yeast cells (S. cerevisiae) under under optimum and oxidative stress conditions. In addition, we successfully quantified the cofactor beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAD(P)H) in single and few cells exposed to the different microenvironments. In conclusion, the microdevice enables to analyze the influence of an external stress factor on the cellular fitness in a fast and more comprehensive way as cell growth and intracellular biomolecule levels can be investigated.},

We also demonstrate a three-dimensional (3D) extension of Cellpose that reuses the two-dimensional (2D) model and does not require 3D-labeled data. To support community contributions to the training data, we developed software for manual labeling and for curation of the automated results. Periodically retraining the model on the community-contributed data will ensure that Cellpose improves constantly.},

The presentation stresses analytical methods, concrete examples, and geometric intuition.

These include mechanical vibrations, lasers, biological rhythms, superconducting circuits, insect outbreaks, chemical oscillators, genetic control systems, chaotic waterwheels, and even a technique for using chaos to send secret messages. In each case, the scientific background is explained at an elementary level and closely integrated with mathematical theory.In the twenty years since the first edition of this book appeared, the ideas and techniques of nonlinear dynamics and chaos have found application to such exciting new fields as systems biology, evolutionary game theory, and sociophysics.

  abstract = {Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) plays an important role in modulating cell signaling and homeostasis in live organisms. The HyPer family of genetically encoded indicators allows the visualization of H2O2 dynamics in live cells within a limited field of view. The visualization of H2O2 within a whole organism with a single cell resolution would benefit from a slowly reducible fluorescent indicator that integrates the H2O2 concentration over desired time scales. This would enable post hoc optical readouts in chemically fixed samples. Herein, we report the development and characterization of NeonOxIrr, a genetically encoded green fluorescent indicator, which rapidly increases fluorescence brightness upon reaction with H2O2, but has a low reduction rate. NeonOxIrr is composed of circularly permutated mNeonGreen fluorescent protein fused to the truncated OxyR transcription factor isolated from E. coli. When compared in vitro to a standard in the field, HyPer3 indicator, NeonOxIrr showed 5.9-fold higher brightness, 15-fold faster oxidation rate, 5.9-fold faster chromophore maturation, similar intensiometric contrast (2.8-fold), 2-fold lower photostability, and significantly higher pH stability both in reduced (pKa of 5.9 vs. \&ge;7.6) and oxidized states (pKa of 5.9 vs.\&ge; 7.9). When expressed in the cytosol of HEK293T cells, NeonOxIrr demonstrated a 2.3-fold dynamic range in response to H2O2 and a 44 min reduction half-time, which were 1.4-fold lower and 7.6-fold longer than those for HyPer3. We also demonstrated and characterized the NeonOxIrr response to H2O2 when the sensor was targeted to the matrix and intermembrane space of the mitochondria, nucleus, cell membranes, peroxisomes, Golgi complex, and endoplasmic reticulum of HEK293T cells. NeonOxIrr could reveal endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in HeLa cells induced with staurosporine but not with thapsigargin or epidermal growth factor. In contrast to HyPer3, NeonOxIrr could visualize optogenetically produced ROS in HEK293T cells. In neuronal cultures, NeonOxIrr preserved its high 3.2-fold dynamic range to H2O2 and slow 198 min reduction half-time. We also demonstrated in HeLa cells that NeonOxIrr preserves a 1.7-fold ex vivo dynamic range to H2O2 upon alkylation with N-ethylmaleimide followed by paraformaldehyde fixation. The same alkylation-fixation procedure in the presence of NP-40 detergent allowed ex vivo detection of H2O2 with 1.5-fold contrast in neuronal cultures and in the cortex of the mouse brain. The slowly reducible H2O2 indicator NeonOxIrr can be used for both the in vivo and ex vivo visualization of ROS. Expanding the family of fixable indicators may be a promising strategy to visualize biological processes at a single cell resolution within an entire organism.},

  abstract = {Rapamycin is an immunosuppressant used for treating many types of diseases such as kidney carcinomas. In yeast, rapamycin inhibits the TORC1 kinase signaling pathway causing rapid alteration in gene expression and ultimately cell cycle arrest in G 1 through mechanisms that are not fully understood. Herein, we screened a histone mutant collection and report that one of the mutants, H2B R95A, is strikingly resistant to rapamycin due to a defective cell cycle arrest. We show that the H2B R95A causes defects in the expression of a subset of genes of the pheromone pathway required for {$\alpha$} factor-induced G 1 arrest. The expression of the STE5 gene and its encoded scaffold protein Ste5, required for the sequential activation of the MAPKs of the pheromone pathway, is greatly reduced in the H2B R95A mutant. Similar to the H2B R95A mutant, cells devoid of Ste5 are also resistant to rapamycin. Rapamycin-induced G 1 arrest does not involve detectable phosphorylation of the MAPKs, Kss1 and Fus3, as reported for {$\alpha$} factor-induced G 1 arrest. However, we observed a sharp induction of the G 1 cyclin Cln2 (\textasciitilde{} 3- to 4-fold) in the ste5{$\Delta$} mutant within 30 mins of exposure to rapamycin. Our data provide a new insight whereby rapamycin signaling via the Torc1 kinase may exploit the pheromone pathway to arrest cells in the G 1 phase.},

  abstract = {Evolution of gene regulation has been proposed to play an important role in environmental adaptation. Exploring mechanisms underlying coordinated evolutionary changes at various levels of gene regulation could shed new light on how organism adapt in nature. In this study, we focused on regulatory differences between a laboratory Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain BY4742 and a pathogenic S. cerevisiae strain, YJM789. The two strains diverge in many features, including growth rate, morphology, high temperature tolerance, and pathogenicity. Our RNA-Seq and ribosomal footprint profiling data showed that gene expression differences are pervasive, and genes functioning in mitochondria are mostly divergent between the two strains at both transcriptional and translational levels. Combining functional genomics data from other yeast strains, we further demonstrated that significant divergence of expression for genes functioning in the electron transport chain (ETC) was likely caused by differential expression of a transcriptional factor, HAP4, and that post-transcriptional regulation mediated by an RNA-binding protein, PUF3, likely led to expression divergence for genes involved in mitochondrial translation. We also explored mito-nuclear interactions via mitochondrial DNA replacement between strains. Although the two mitochondrial genomes harbor substantial sequence divergence, neither growth nor gene expression were affected by mitochondrial DNA replacement in both fermentative and respiratory growth media, indicating compatible mitochondrial and nuclear genomes between these two strains in the tested conditions. Collectively, we used mitochondrial functions as an example to demonstrate for the first time that evolution at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels could lead to coordinated regulatory changes underlying strain specific functional variations.},

Several theoretical robust genetic circuits have been designed, but their performance under real-world conditions has not yet been carefully evaluated. Here, we designed and synthesized a new robust perfect adaptation circuit composed of two-node negative feedback coupling with linear positive feedback on the buffer node. As a key feature, the linear positive feedback was fine-tuned to evaluate its necessity. We found that the desired function was robustly achieved when genetic parameters were varied by systematically perturbing all interacting parts within the topology, and the necessity of the completeness of the topological structures was evaluated by destroying key circuit features. Furthermore, different environmental perturbances were imposed onto the circuit by changing growth rates, carbon metabolic strategies and even chassis cells, and the designed perfect adaptation function was still achieved under all conditions. The successful design of a robust perfect adaptation circuit indicated that the top-down design strategy is capable of predictably guiding bottom-up engineering for robust genetic circuits. This robust adaptation circuit could be integrated as a motif into more complex circuits to robustly implement more sophisticated and critical biological functions.},

  abstract = {Biosynthesis scales with cell size such that protein concentrations generally remain constant as cells grow. As an exception, synthesis of the cell-cycle inhibitor Whi5 ``sub-scales'' with cell size so that its concentration is lower in larger cells to promote cell-cycle entry. Here, we find that transcriptional control uncouples Whi5 synthesis from cell size, and we identify histones as the major class of sub-scaling transcripts besides WHI5 by screening for similar genes. Histone synthesis is thereby matched to genome content rather than cell size. Such sub-scaling proteins are challenged by asymmetric cell division because proteins are typically partitioned in proportion to newborn cell volume. To avoid this fate, Whi5 uses chromatin-binding to partition similar protein amounts to each newborn cell regardless of cell size. Disrupting both Whi5 synthesis and chromatin-based partitioning weakens G1 size control. Thus, specific transcriptional and partitioning mechanisms determine protein sub-scaling to control cell size.},

Here, we review recent exciting discoveries that point out different causes for metabolic heterogeneity within clonal microbial populations. These causes range from ecological factors and cell-inherent dynamics in constant environments to molecular noise in gene expression that propagates into metabolism. Furthermore, we provide an overview of current methods to quantify the levels of metabolites and biomass components in single cells.},

Here, we show that key biosynthetic processes are temporally segregated along the cell cycle. Using budding yeast as a model and single-cell methods to dynamically measure metabolic activity, we observe two peaks in protein synthesis, in the G1 and S/G2/M phase, whereas lipid and polysaccharide synthesis peaks only once, during the S/G2/M phase. Integrating the inferred biosynthetic rates into a thermodynamic-stoichiometric metabolic model, we find that this temporal segregation in biosynthetic processes causes flux changes in primary metabolism, with an acceleration of glucose-uptake flux in G1 and phase-shifted oscillations of oxygen and carbon dioxide exchanges. Through experimental validation of the model predictions, we demonstrate that primary metabolism oscillates with cell-cycle periodicity to satisfy the changing demands of biosynthetic processes exhibiting unexpected dynamics during the cell cycle.},

High solubility of CO2 in fermentation media, contributing to enjoyable sensory properties of sparkling wine and beers by S. cerevisiae, might affect yeast metabolism. To elucidate the overlooked effects of CO2 on yeast metabolism, we examined glucose fermentation by S. cerevisiae under CO2 as compared to N2 and O2 limited conditions. While both CO2 and N2 conditions are considered anaerobic, less glycerol and acetate but more ethanol were produced under CO2 condition. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that significantly decreased mRNA levels of GPP1 coding for glycerol-3-phosphate phosphatase in glycerol synthesis explained the reduced glycerol production under CO2 condition. Besides, transcriptional regulations in signal transduction, carbohydrate synthesis, heme synthesis, membrane and cell wall metabolism, and respiration were detected in response to CO2. Interestingly, signal transduction was uniquely regulated under CO2 condition, where up-regulated genes (STE3, MSB2, WSC3, STE12 and TEC1) in the signal sensors and transcriptional factors suggested that MAPK signaling pathway plays a critical role in CO2 sensing and CO2-induced metabolisms in yeast. Our study identifies CO2 as an external stimulus for modulating metabolic activities in yeast and a transcriptional effector for diverse applications.},

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) uses computational models to perform complex experiments that are otherwise prohibitively expensive or require a microgravity environment. Similarly, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) have began accepting models and simulations as form of evidence for pharmaceutical and medical device approval. It is crucial that computational models meet a standard of credibility when using them in high-stakes decision making. For this reason, institutes including NASA, the FDA, and the EMA have developed standards to promote and assess the credibility of computational models and simulations. However, due to the breadth of models these institutes assess, these credibility standards are mostly qualitative and avoid making specific recommendations. On the other hand, modeling and simulation in systems biology is a narrow domain and several standards are already in place. As systems biology models increase in complexity and influence, the development of a credibility assessment system is crucial. Here we review existing standards in systems biology, credibility standards in other science, engineering, and medical fields, and propose the development of a credibility standard for systems biology models.},

Because of their biocompatibility and ease of fabrication, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-glass-based devices are most prominent. Especially the successful and reproducible cultivation of cells in microfluidic systems, ranging from bacteria over algae and fungi to mammalians, is a fundamental step for further quantitative biological analysis. In combination with live-cell imaging, MC devices allow the cultivation of small cell clusters (or even single cells) under defined environmental conditions and with high spatio-temporal resolution. Yet, most setups in use are custom made and only few standardised setups are available, making trouble-free application and inter-laboratory transfer tricky. Therefore, we provide a guideline to overcome the most frequently occurring challenges during a MC experiment to allow untrained users to learn the application of continuous-flow-based MC devices. By giving a concise overview of the respective workflow, we give the reader a general understanding of the whole procedure and its most common pitfalls. Additionally, we complement the listing of challenges with solutions to overcome these hurdles. On selected case studies, covering successful and reproducible growth of cells in MC devices, we demonstrate detailed solutions to solve occurring challenges as a blueprint for further troubleshooting. Since developer and end-user of MC devices are often different persons, we believe that our guideline will help to enhance a broader applicability of MC in the field of life science and eventually promote the ongoing advancement of MC.},

We successfully developed and applied a differential method to obtain a reliable set of metabolome data for Escherichia coli K12 MG1655 grown in steady-state, aerobic, glucose-limited chemostat cultures. From a rigorous analysis of the commonly applied quenching procedure based on cold aqueous methanol, it was concluded that it was not applicable because of release of a major part of the metabolites from the cells. No positive effect of buffering or increasing the ionic strength of the quenching solution was observed. Application of a differential method in principle requires metabolite measurements in total broth and filtrate for each measurement. Different methods for sampling of culture filtrate were examined, and it was found that direct filtration without cooling of the sample was the most appropriate. Analysis of culture filtrates revealed that most of the central metabolites and amino acids were present in significant amounts outside the cells. Because the turnover time of the pools of extracellular metabolites is much larger than that of the intracellular pools, the differential method should also be applicable to short-term pulse response experiments without requiring measurement of metabolites in the supernatant during the dynamic period.},

Significant fold changes in metabolites (10\textendash 1/10) and fluxes (4\textendash 1/4) were observed during the short (200s) period of glucose excess. During glucose excess there was no secretion of by-products and the increased glucose uptake rate led within 40s to a 3.7 fold increase in growth rate. Also within 40\textendash 60s a new pseudo-steady-state was reached for both metabolite levels and fluxes. Flux changes of reactions were strongly correlated to the concentrations of involved compounds. Surprisingly the 3.7 fold increase in growth rate and hence protein synthesis rate was not matched by a significant increase in amino acid concentrations.

One of the uncertainties in the metabolic networks is the exact stoichiometry of energy generating and consuming processes. Accurate estimation of biomass and product yields requires correct information on the ATP stoichiometry. The unknown ATP stoichiometry parameters of the constructed E. coli network were estimated from experimental data of eight different aerobic chemostat experiments carried out with E. coli MG1655, grown at different dilution rates (0.025, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.3 h(-1)) and on different carbon substrates (glucose, glycerol, and acetate). Proper estimation of the ATP stoichiometry requires proper information on the biomass composition of the organism as well as accurate assessment of net conversion rates under well-defined conditions. For this purpose a growth rate dependent biomass composition was derived, based on measurements and literature data. After incorporation of the growth rate dependent biomass composition in a metabolic network model, an effective P/O ratio of 1.49 +/- 0.26 mol of ATP/mol of O, K(X) (growth dependent maintenance) of 0.46 +/- 0.27 mol of ATP/C-mol of biomass and m(ATP) (growth independent maintenance) of 0.075 +/- 0.015 mol of ATP/C-mol of biomass/h were estimated using a newly developed Comprehensive Data Reconciliation (CDR) method, assuming that the three energetic parameters were independent of the growth rate and the used substrate. The resulting metabolic network model only requires the specific rate of growth, micro, as an input in order to accurately predict all other fluxes and yields.},

Here, we hypothesize that observed variation can be explained in terms of a compromise between factors that favor minimizing metabolite pool sizes (e.g. limited solvent capacity) and the need to effectively utilize existing enzymes. The latter requires adequate thermodynamic driving force in metabolic reactions so that forward flux substantially exceeds reverse flux. To test this hypothesis, we developed a method, metabolic tug-of-war (mTOW), which computes steady-state metabolite concentrations in microorganisms on a genome-scale. mTOW is shown to explain up to 55\% of the observed variation in measured metabolite concentrations in E. coli and C. acetobutylicum across various growth media. Our approach, based strictly on first thermodynamic principles, is the first method that successfully predicts high-throughput metabolite concentration data in bacteria across conditions.},

  abstract = {We present an analysis of glycolysis based on experimental findings and an interpretation based on concepts of efficiency, resonance response, and control features available in highly nonlinear reaction kinetics. We begin with a model for the glycolytic mechanism that is comprehensive, includes a large number of known activations and inhibitions of enzymes by metabolites, and couples the phosphofructokinase (PFKase) and the pyruvate kinase (PKase) reactions. The PFKase and PKase reactions and the coupling between them are modeled according to experimental information, but we do not attempt to model the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-3-phosphoglycerate kinase reaction. We use experimental data to obtain the best estimates for the kinetic parameters and test the model by calculating the concentration variations of the intermediate metabolites. We confirm oscillatory behavior and calculate the ATP/ADP ratio and the free-energy dissipation for an extended range of the kinetic parameters as a function of the driving force for the glycolytic pathway, a measure of which is the total adenine nucleotide concentration. We find agreement of the calculated results with experimental findings except for the insufficiently represented reactions. Our model shows that the average ATP/ADP ratio is increased and the average free-energy dissipation is decreased in an oscillatory compared with a steady state mode of operation. The average values of the ATP/ADP ratio and of the free energy dissipation change abruptly past the onset of sustained oscillations.},

  abstract = {The budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has emerged as a model system for studying the aging processes in eukaryotic cells. However, the full complement of tools available in this organism has not been fully applied, in part because of limitations in throughput that restrict the ability to carry out detailed analyses. Recent advances in microfluidics have provided direct longitudinal observation of entire yeast lifespans, but have not yet achieved the normal scale of operation possible in this model system. Here we present a microfluidic platform, called the Yeast Lifespan Machine, where we combine improvements in microfluidics, image acquisition, and image analysis tools to increase robustness and throughput of lifespan measurements in aging yeast cells. We demonstrate the platform's ability to measure the lifespan of large populations of cells and distinguish long- and short-lived mutants, all with minimal involvement of the experimenter. We also show that environmental pH is capable of significantly modulating lifespan depending on the growth media, highlighting how microfluidic technologies reveal determinants of lifespan that are otherwise difficult to ascertain.},

Oscillations in these variables have the same frequency as oscillations in the activity of intracellular metabolites, suggesting strong coupling between them. These results can be interpreted in light of a recently proposed theoretical formalism in which isentropic thermodynamic systems can display coupled oscillations in all extensive and intensive variables, reminiscent of adiabatic waves. This interpretation suggests that oscillations may be a consequence of the requirement of living cells for a constant low-entropy state while simultaneously performing biochemical transformations, i.e., remaining metabolically active. This hypothesis, which is in line with the view of the cellular interior as a highly structured and near equilibrium system where energy inputs can be low and sustain regular oscillatory regimes, calls into question the notion that metabolic processes are essentially dissipative.},

  abstract = {A class of theoretical models seeks to explain rhythmic single cell data by postulating that they are generated by intrinsic noise in biochemical systems whose deterministic models exhibit only damped oscillations. The main features of such noise-induced oscillations are quantified by the power spectrum which measures the dependence of the oscillatory signal's power with frequency. In this paper we derive an approximate closed-form expression for the power spectrum of any monostable biochemical system close to a Hopf bifurcation, where noise-induced oscillations are most pronounced. Unlike the commonly used linear noise approximation which is valid in the macroscopic limit of large volumes, our theory is valid over a wide range of volumes and hence affords a more suitable description of single cell noise-induced oscillations. Our theory predicts that the spectra have three universal features: (i) a dominant peak at some frequency, (ii) a smaller peak at twice the frequency of the dominant peak and (iii) a peak at zero frequency. Of these, the linear noise approximation predicts only the first feature while the remaining two stem from the combination of intrinsic noise and nonlinearity in the law of mass action. The theoretical expressions are shown to accurately match the power spectra determined from stochastic simulations of mitotic and circadian oscillators. Furthermore it is shown how recently acquired single cell rhythmic fibroblast data displays all the features predicted by our theory and that the experimental spectrum is well described by our theory but not by the conventional linear noise approximation.},

Alongside we provide a theory to analyse stochastic chemical reactions coupled with cell divisions, enabling efficient parameter estimation, sensitivity analysis and hypothesis testing. The cell model recovers population-averaged data on growth-dependence of bacterial physiology and how growth variations in single cells change across conditions. We identify processes responsible for this variation and reconstruct the propagation of initial fluctuations to growth and other processes. Finally, we study drug-nutrient interactions and find that antibiotics can both enhance and suppress growth heterogeneity.

  abstract = {Background: Bronchogenic carcinoma (lung cancer) is one of the leading causes of death. Although many compounds isolated from natural products have been used to treat it, drug resistance is a serious problem, and alternative anti-cancer drugs are required. Here, melittin from Apis mellifera venom was used, and its effects on bronchogenic carcinoma cell proliferation and tumour-associated macrophage differentiation were evaluated. Methods: The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of melittin was measured by MTT. Cell death was observed by annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) co-staining followed by flow cytometry. Cell cycle arrest was revealed by PI staining and flow cytometry. To investigate the tumour microenvironment, differentiation of circulating monocytes (THP-1) into tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) was assayed by sandwich-ELISA and interleukin (IL)-10 levels were determined. Cell proliferation and migration was observed by flat plate colony formation. Secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was detected by ELISA. The change in expression levels of CatS, Bcl-2, and MADD was measured by quantitative RT-PCR. Results: Melittin was significantly more cytotoxic (p {$<$} 0.01) to human bronchogenic carcinoma cells (ChaGo-K1) than to the control human lung fibroblasts (Wi-38) cells. At 2.5 {$\mu$}M, melittin caused ChaGo-K1 cells to undergo apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. The IL-10 levels showed that melittin significantly inhibited the differentiation of THP-1 cells into TAMs (p {$<$} 0.05) and reduced the number of colonies formed in the treated ChaGo-K1 cells compared to the untreated cells. However, melittin did not affect angiogenesis in ChaGo-K1 cells. Unlike MADD, Bcl-2 was up-regulated significantly (p {$<$} 0.05) in melittin-treated ChaGo-K1 cells. Conclusion: Melittin can be used as an alternative agent for lung cancer treatment because of its cytotoxicity against ChaGo-K1 cells and the inhibition of differentiation of THP-1 cells into TAMs.},

We recovered a hypothetical gene YLR053c, renamed NRS1 for Nitrogen-Responsive Start regulator 1, which encodes a poorly characterized 108 amino acid microprotein. Endogenous Nrs1 was nuclear-localized, restricted to poor nitrogen conditions, induced upon TORC1 inhibition, and cell cycle-regulated with a peak at Start. NRS1 interacted genetically with SWI4 and SWI6, which encode subunits of the main G1/S transcription factor complex SBF. Correspondingly, Nrs1 physically interacted with Swi4 and Swi6 and was localized to G1/S promoter DNA. Nrs1 exhibited inherent transactivation activity, and fusion of Nrs1 to the SBF inhibitor Whi5 was sufficient to suppress other Start defects. Nrs1 appears to be a recently evolved microprotein that rewires the G1/S transcriptional machinery under poor nitrogen conditions.},

In this article we show, using the linear-noise approximation of the chemical master equation, that noise can also induce oscillations in systems whose deterministic descriptions admit no damped oscillations, i.e., systems with a stable node. This non-intuitive phenomenon is remarkable since, unlike noise-induced oscillations in systems with damped deterministic oscillations, it cannot be explained by noise excitation of the deterministic resonant frequency of the system. We here prove the following general properties of stable-node noise-induced oscillations for systems with two species: (i) the upper bound of their frequency is given by the geometric mean of the real eigenvalues of the Jacobian of the system, (ii) the upper bound of the Q-factor of the oscillations is inversely proportional to the distance between the real eigenvalues of the Jacobian, and (iii) these oscillations are not necessarily exhibited by all interacting chemical species in the system. The existence and properties of stable-node oscillations are verified by stochastic simulations of the Brusselator, a cascade Brusselator reaction system, and two other simple chemical systems involving auto-catalysis and trimerization. It is also shown how external noise induces stable node oscillations with different properties than those stimulated by internal noise.},

  abstract = {A wide range of cellular processes are inherently stochastic. While stochasticity of gene transcription and translation or cellular growth profiles is well-understood, little is known about the stochastic properties of metabolism. Recent experimental findings strongly suggest that metabolism may indeed be subject to stochastic phenomena, which has questioned the traditional deterministic view of metabolism and casts crucial doubt on the general validity of this modelling paradigm. In this thesis, we examine stochastic aspects of metabolic reactions in detail. We focus on stochastic versions of classic deterministic models for metabolic reactions coupled with well-established stochastic models for gene expression. We incorporate experimental measurements of kinetic parameters in the study, which results in a specific multiscale structure of the presented class of models. In the course of this thesis, we present numerous models with increasing complexity, focussing on three key contributions. Firstly, we present the derivation of an analytical tool to approximate stationary metabolite distributions in closed-form by exploiting the multiple scales. As a result, we propose a strikingly-accurate analytical tool for exploring the parameter space. Secondly, we reveal which parameters have strong impacts on the stationary metabolite distributions and identify conditions for increased coefficients of variation and highly-complex bimodal and multimodal patterns. Finally, we propose a general strategy to obtain closed-form approximations in more complex models, such as multi-step pathways and regulatory processes commonly found in metabolism, such as allostery or end-product inhibition. The results in this thesis lay the groundwork for future studies of metabolic heterogeneity and offer numerous biological hypotheses that could soon be tested in light of recent progress in single-cell measurements of cellular metabolites.},

One of the most popular algorithms for uncovering community structure is the so-called Louvain algorithm. We show that this algorithm has a major defect that largely went unnoticed until now: the Louvain algorithm may yield arbitrarily badly connected communities. In the worst case, communities may even be disconnected, especially when running the algorithm iteratively. In our experimental analysis, we observe that up to 25\% of the communities are badly connected and up to 16\% are disconnected. To address this problem, we introduce the Leiden algorithm. We prove that the Leiden algorithm yields communities that are guaranteed to be connected. In addition, we prove that, when the Leiden algorithm is applied iteratively, it converges to a partition in which all subsets of all communities are locally optimally assigned. Furthermore, by relying on a fast local move approach, the Leiden algorithm runs faster than the Louvain algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of the Leiden algorithm for several benchmark and real-world networks. We find that the Leiden algorithm is faster than the Louvain algorithm and uncovers better partitions, in addition to providing explicit guarantees.},

While modularity remains one of the more popular methods of community detection, the so-called resolution limit remains a significant drawback. To overcome this issue, it was recently suggested that instead of comparing the network to a random null model, as is done in modularity, it should be compared to a constant factor. However, it is unclear what is meant exactly by ``resolution-limit-free,'' that is, not suffering from the resolution limit. Furthermore, the question remains what other methods could be classified as resolution-limit-free. In this paper we suggest a rigorous definition and derive some basic properties of resolution-limit-free methods. More importantly, we are able to prove exactly which class of community detection methods are resolution-limit-free. Furthermore, we analyze which methods are not resolution-limit-free, suggesting there is only a limited scope for resolution-limit-free community detection methods. Finally, we provide such a natural formulation, and show it performs superbly.},

  abstract = {Due to the lack of alternatives, time-lapse single-cell microscopy relies upon phototoxic fluorescence markers, which potentially affect the function of the tagged protein, to monitor cellular processes, like the cell cycle. Here, a deep learning algorithm to identify cell cycle stages based on more readily available and less harmful bright-field images is presented. I first created an image dataset that is labelled via Free-Knot B-spline approximation of HTB2, a histone level marker, to distinguish four cell cycle stages in S. cerevisiae. The constructed dataset is validated by identifying biologically consistent cell cycle durations. It then serves as the ground truth dataset for the supervised training of a convolutional neural network. I demonstrate that it is possible to train a deep learning network to classify cell cycle stages from a bright-field image input by deliberately overfitting the neural network. However, an increased focus on the identification of individual cells and the exploration of transfer learning are required to improve generalisation and remove the need for fluorescence markers by deep learning in single-cell microscopy.},

Here, we describe a high-throughput strategy for quantifying robustness of multiple cellular functions and strains in a perturbation space. We evaluated quantification theory on experimental data and concluded that the mean-normalized Fano factor allowed accurate, reliable, and standardized quantification. Our methodology applied to perturbations related to lignocellulosic bioethanol production showed that the industrial bioethanol producing strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ethanol Red exhibited both higher and more robust growth rates than the laboratory strain CEN.PK and industrial strain PE-2, while a more robust product yield traded off for lower mean levels. The methodology validated that robustness is function-specific and characterized by positive and negative function-specific trade-offs. Systematic quantification of robustness to end-use perturbations will be important to analyze and construct robust strains with more predictable functions.},

Through computational studies, we show that it is generally difficult to adjust a negative feedback oscillator's frequency without compromising its amplitude, whereas with positive-plus-negative feedback, one can achieve a widely tunable frequency and near-constant amplitude. This tunability makes the latter design suitable for biological rhythms like heartbeats and cell cycles that need to provide a constant output over a range of frequencies. Positive-plus-negative oscillators also appear to be more robust and easier to evolve, rationalizing why they are found in contexts where an adjustable frequency is unimportant.},

In striking contrast to previous observations, we show that in S. cerevisiae the B-type cyclin CLB2 mRNA is localized and translated in the yeast bud, while the Clb2 protein, a key regulator of mitosis progression, is concentrated in the mother nucleus. Using single-molecule RNA imaging in fixed (smFISH) and living cells (MS2 system), we show that the CLB2 mRNA is transported to the yeast bud by the She2-She3 complex, via an mRNA ZIP-code situated in the coding sequence. In CLB2 mRNA localization mutants, Clb2 protein synthesis in the bud is decreased resulting in changes in cell cycle distribution and genetic instability. Altogether, we propose that CLB2 mRNA localization acts as a sensor for bud development to couple cell growth and cell cycle progression, revealing a novel function for mRNA localization.},

  abstract = {Reference strains improve reproducibility by standardizing observations and methodology, which has ultimately led to important insights into fungal pathogenesis. However, recent investigations have highlighted significant genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity across isolates that influence genetic circuitry and virulence within a species. Candida glabrata is the second leading cause of candidiasis, a life-threatening infection, and undergoes extensive karyotype and phenotypic changes in response to stress. Much of the work conducted on this pathogen has focused on two sequenced strains, CBS138 (ATCC 2001) and BG2. Few studies have compared these strains in detail, but key differences include mating type and altered patterns of expression of EPA adhesins. In fact, most C. glabrata isolates and BG2 are MATa, while CBS138 is MAT{$\alpha$}. However, it is not known if other phenotypic differences between these strains play a role in our understanding of C. glabrata pathogenesis. Thus, we set out to characterize metabolic, cell wall, and host-interaction attributes for CBS138 and BG2. We found that BG2 utilized a broader range of nitrogen sources and had reduced cell wall size and carbohydrate exposure than CBS138, which we hypothesized results in differences in innate immune interactions and virulence. We observed that, although both strains were phagocytosed to a similar extent, BG2 replicated to higher numbers in macrophages and was more virulent during Galleria mellonella infection than CBS138 in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, deletion of SNF3, a major nutrient sensor, did not affect virulence in G. mellonella for BG2, but significantly enhanced larval killing in the CBS138 background compared to the parent strain. Understanding these fundamental differences in metabolism and host interactions will allow more robust conclusions to be drawn in future studies of C. glabrata pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE Reference strains provide essential insights into the mechanisms underlying virulence in fungal pathogens. However, recent studies in Candida albicans and other species have revealed significant genotypic and phenotypic diversity within clinical isolates that are challenging paradigms regarding key virulence factors and their regulation. Candida glabrata is the second leading cause of candidiasis, and many studies use BG2 or CBS138 for their investigations. Therefore, we aimed to characterize important virulence-related phenotypes for both strains that might alter conclusions about C. glabrata pathogenesis. Our study provides context for metabolic and cell wall changes and how these may influence host interaction phenotypes. Understanding these differences is necessary to support robust conclusions about how virulence factors may function in these and other very different strain backgrounds.},

  abstract = {The mammalian circadian clock is located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and consists of a network of coupled neurons, which are entrained to the environmental light-dark cycle. The phase coherence of the neurons is plastic and driven by the duration of daylight. With aging, the capacity to behaviorally adapt to seasonal changes in photoperiod reduces. The mechanisms underlying photoperiodic adaptation are largely unknown, but are important to unravel for the development of novel interventions to improve the quality of life of the elderly. We analyzed the phase coherence of single-cell PERIOD2:: LUCIFERASE (PER2::LUC) expression rhythms in the SCN of young and old mice entrained to either long or short photoperiod. The phase coherence was used as input to a 2-community noisy Kuramoto model to estimate the coupling strength between and within neuronal subpopulations. The model revealed a correlation between coupling strength and photoperiod-induced changes in the phase relationship among neurons, suggesting a functional link. We found that the SCN of young mice adapts in coupling strength over a large range, with weak coupling in long photoperiod (LP) and strong coupling in short photoperiod (SP). In aged mice, we also found weak coupling in LP, but a reduced capacity to reach strong coupling in SP. The inability to respond with an increase in coupling strength suggests that manipulation of photoperiod is not a suitable strategy to enhance clock function with aging. We conclude that the inability of aged mice to reach strong coupling contributes to deficits in behavioral adaptation to seasonal changes in photoperiod.},

  abstract = {A modeling formalism has been developed recently, based on stoichiometry and linear optimization, that enables determination of the capabilities of metabolic networks. Both single and multiple simultaneous metabolic demands can be studied within this formalism. Here, we use this approach to determine the ability of Escherichia coli's fueling reactions to meet growth demands. "Growth" within this context is defined as a drain of biosynthetic precursors in an appropriate ratio required to produce cellular components. Maximizing biomass yield on glucose in the absence of maintenance requirements, we obtain a yield of 0{$\cdot$}588 g DW g-1 glucose, which is higher than experimentally reported values. Inclusion of ATP maintenance costs significantly influences the maximal biomass yield. A maintenance cost of 4-6 ATP molecules per glucose consumed gives maximal biomass yields of 0{$\cdot$}4-0{$\cdot$}45 g DW g-1 glucose, which correspond to experimental observations of biomass yields. The corresponding metabolic flux distribution shows a remarkable consistency with experimental observations of pathway utilization, including the fraction of glucose metabolized through the pentose pathway, use of the anaplerotic reactions and redox metabolism. A sensitivity analysis demonstrates a robustness of the optimal biomass yield and pathway utilization to changes in metabolic demands. This result is important considering the diversity of metabolic demands that the cell can experience under different growth and environmental conditions. The optimal biomass yield varies significantly, approximately 20\%, over the range of P/O ratios found in energy-transducing membranes. A new metric that is based on shadow prices is formulated to measure the relative importance of the biosynthetic precursors to biomass generation. Interestingly, it identifies the sugar monophosphates as the best utilized biosynthetic precursors for growth in the absence of maintenance energy, although they are needed in relatively small amounts. With maintenance costs, ATP assumes a similar importance. With acetate as the sole substrate we show numerical comparisons of the optimal flux distribution with experimental determinations reported in the literature. We find the optimal solution to be in close agreement with experimentally determined pathway utilizations, the measured metabolic flux levels and biomass yields. Taken together, the results presented here argue for the hypothesis that observed metabolic behavior is consistent with stoichiometric optimality of growth and that regulation of metabolism strives to achieve this stoichiometric optimality.},

  abstract = {Addition of benzoate to the medium reservoir of glucose-limited chemostat cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae CBS 8066 growing at a dilution rate (D) of 0.10 h-1 resulted in a decrease in the biomass yield, and an increase in the specific oxygen uptake rate (qO2) from 2.5 to as high as 19.5 mmol g-1h-1. Above a critical concentration, the presence of benzoate led to alcoholic fermentation and a reduction in (qO2) to 13 mmol g-1h-1. The stimulatory effect of benzoate on respiration was dependent on the dilution rate: at high dilution rates respiration was not enhanced by benzoate. Cells could only gradually adapt to growth in the presence of benzoate: a pulse of benzoate given directly to the culture resulted in wash-out. As the presence of benzoate in cultures growing at low dilution rates resulted in large changes in the catabolic glucose flux, it was of interest of study the effect of benzoate on the residual glucose concentration in the fermenter as well as on the level of some selected enzymes. At D=0.10 h-1, the residual glucose concentration increased proportionally with increasing benzoate concentration. This suggests that modulation of the glucose flux mainly occurs via a change in the entracellular glucose concentration rather than by synthesis of an additional amount of carriers. Also various intracellular enzyme levels were not positively correlated with the rate of respiration. A notable exception was citrate synthase: its level increased with increasing respiration rate. Growth ofS. cerevisiae in ethanol-limited cultures in the presence of benzoate also led to very high qO2 levels of 19\textendash 21 mmol g-1h-1. During growth on glucose as well as on ethanol, the presence of benzoate coincided with an increase in the mitochondrial volume up to one quarter of the total cellular volume. Also with the Crabtree-negative yeasts Candida utilis, Kluyveromyces marxianus andHansenula polymorpha, growth in the presence of benzoate resulted in an increase in qO2 and, at high concentrations of benzoate, in aerobic fermentation. In contrast to S.Cerevisiae, the highest qO2 of these yeasts when growing at D = 0.10 h-1 in the presence of benzoate was equal to, or lower than the qO2 attainable at {$\mu$}max without benzoate. Enzyme activities that were repressed by glucose in S. cerevisiae also declined in K.Marxianus when the glucose flux was increased by the presence of benzoate. The maximal aerobic fermentation rate at D = 0.10 h-1 of the Crabtree-negative yeasts at high benzoate concentrations was considerably lower than for S. cerevisiae. This is probably due to the fact that under aerobic conditions these yeasts are unable to raise the low basal pyruvate decarboxylase level: cultivation without benzoate under oxygen-limited conditions resulted in rates of alcoholic fermentation and levels of pyruvate decarboxylase comparable to those of S. cerevisiae.},

However, these have mostly been adapted to work well with specific data and need to be manually adapted for a wider usage. We describe a software framework dedicated to a comprehensive analysis of rhythmic datasets. It integrates different state-of-the-art methods dedicated to the identification and characterisation of rhythmic processes. It allows its users to straightforwardly apply different methods to a selected dataset, and to identify the method yielding the results with the largest relevance in a given context. We demonstrate the application of the proposed framework on two examples. Firstly, we report the results of a benchmarking experiment, which also indicate the classification performance of each of the implemented methods (i.e., classifying measurements among rhythmic and non-rhythmic groups). Secondly, we present the application of the proposed framework on the assessment of rhythmic trends in traffic data reflecting circadian rhythmicity. We believe that the proposed package will find a vast scope of applications in different scientific domains.},

We use regularized flux balance analysis to observe flux response between conditions across photosynthesis and energy metabolism. We then incorporate principal-component analysis, k-means clustering, and LASSO regularization to reduce dimensionality and extract key cross-omic features. Our results suggest that combining metabolic modeling with machine learning elucidates mechanisms used by cyanobacteria to cope with fluctuations in light intensity and salinity that cannot be detected using transcriptomics alone. Furthermore, GSMMs introduce critical mechanistic details that improve the performance of omic-based machine learning methods.},

Using a combination of molecular genetics and omics approaches, we demonstrate the evolution of fast growth overcomes these amino acid deficiencies, by alleviating a perturbation in mitochondrial iron metabolism and by restoring a defect in the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle, caused by aconitase inhibition. Our results hence explain the slow growth of mitochondrial genome-deficient cells with a partial auxotrophy in four amino acids that results from distorted iron metabolism and an inhibited tricarboxylic acid cycle.},

Such analyses largely leave out how and why ATP, NADH, and acetyl-CoA (Figure 1) at the molecular level play such central roles. Yet, without those insights into why cells accumulate them and how the enabling properties of these key metabolites power much of cell metabolism, the underlying molecular logic remains mysterious. Four other metabolites, S-adenosylmethionine, carbamoyl phosphate, UDP-glucose, and {$\Delta$}2-isopentenyl-PP play similar roles in using group transfer chemistry to drive otherwise unfavorable biosynthetic equilibria. This review provides the underlying chemical logic to remind how these seven key molecules function as mobile packets of cellular currencies for phosphoryl transfers (ATP), acyl transfers (acetyl-CoA, carbamoyl-P), methyl transfers (SAM), prenyl transfers (IPP), glucosyl transfers (UDP-glucose), and electron and ADP-ribosyl transfers (NAD(P)H/NAD(P)+) to drive metabolic transformations in and across most primary pathways. The eighth key metabolite is molecular oxygen (O2), thermodynamically activated for reduction by one electron path, leaving it kinetically stable to the vast majority of organic cellular metabolites.},

Here we construct the organization of this methionine-mediated anabolic program using yeast. Combining comparative transcriptome analysis and biochemical and metabolic flux-based approaches, we discover that methionine rewires overall metabolic outputs by increasing the activity of a key regulatory node. This comprises the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) coupled with reductive biosynthesis, the glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH)-dependent synthesis of glutamate/glutamine, and pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP)-dependent transamination capacity. This PPP-GDH-PLP node provides the required cofactors and/or substrates for subsequent rate-limiting reactions in the synthesis of amino acids and therefore nucleotides. These rate-limiting steps in amino acid biosynthesis are also induced in a methionine-dependent manner. This thereby results in a biochemical cascade establishing a hierarchically organized anabolic program. For this methionine-mediated anabolic program to be sustained, cells co-opt a ``starvation stress response'' regulator, Gcn4p. Collectively, our data suggest a hierarchical metabolic framework explaining how methionine mediates an anabolic switch.},

  abstract = {The cell cycle is the series of events that take place in a cell that drives it to divide and produce two new daughter cells. Through more than 100~years of efforts by scientists, we now have a much clearer picture of cell cycle progression and its regulation. The typical cell cycle in eukaryotes is composed of the G1, S, G2, and M phases. The M phase is further divided into prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase, and cytokinesis. Cell cycle progression is mediated by cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) and their regulatory cyclin subunits. However, the driving force of cell cycle progression is growth factor-initiated signaling pathways that controls the activity of various Cdk-cyclin complexes. Most cellular events, including DNA duplication, gene transcription, protein translation, and post-translational modification of proteins, occur in a cell-cycle-dependent manner. To understand these cellular events and their underlying molecular mechanisms, it is desirable to have a population of cells that are traversing the cell cycle synchronously. This can be achieved through a process called cell synchronization. Many methods have been developed to synchronize cells to the various phases of the cell cycle. These methods could be classified into two groups: synchronization methods using chemical inhibitors and synchronization methods without using chemical inhibitors. All these methods have their own merits and shortcomings.},

We estimated the genome-wide synthetic and degradative cost of transcription and translation in three organisms and found that the cost of cycling genes is strikingly higher compared to non-cycling genes. Cycling genes are expressed at high levels and constitute the most costly proteins to synthesize in the genome. We demonstrate that metabolic cycling is accelerated in yeast grown under higher nutrient flux and the number of cycling genes increases {$\sim$}40\%, which are achieved by increasing the amplitude and not the mean level of gene expression. These results suggest that rhythmic gene expression optimizes the metabolic cost of global gene expression and that highly expressed genes have been selected to be downregulated in a cyclic manner for energy conservation.},

Recent experiments indicated that feedback regulation plays an important role in controlling the noise in gene expression. A quantitative understanding of the feedback effect on gene expression requires analysis of the corresponding stochastic model. However, for stochastic models of gene expression with general regulation functions, exact analytical results for gene product distributions have not been given so far. Here, we propose a technique to solve a generalized ON-OFF model of stochastic gene expression with arbitrary (positive or negative, linear or nonlinear) feedbacks including posttranscriptional or posttranslational regulation. The obtained results, which generalize results obtained previously, provide new insights into the role of feedback in regulating gene expression. The proposed analytical framework can easily be extended to analysis of more complex models of stochastic gene expression.},

The search for the molecular mechanism of diauxie led to the discovery of the lac operon. However, questions remain as why microbes would bother to have different strategies of taking up nutrients. Here we show that diauxie versus co-utilization can be understood from the topological features of the metabolic network. A model of optimal allocation of protein resources quantitatively explains why and how the cell makes the choice. In case of co-utilization, the model predicts the percentage of each carbon source in supplying the amino acid pools, which is quantitatively verified by experiments. Our work solves a long-standing puzzle and provides a quantitative framework for the carbon source utilization of microbes.},

Therefore, their mRNA and protein concentrations change as the cell volume increases, which often have crucial biological functions such as cell-cycle regulation. However, the biophysical mechanism underlying the nonlinear scaling between gene expression and cell volume is still unclear. In this work, we show that the nonlinear scaling is a direct consequence of the heterogeneous recruitment abilities of promoters to RNA polymerases based on a gene expression model at the whole-cell level. Those genes with weaker (stronger) recruitment abilities than the average ability spontaneously exhibit superlinear (sublinear) scaling with cell volume. Analysis of the promoter sequences and the nonlinear scaling of Saccharomyces cerevisiae's mRNA levels shows that motifs associated with transcription regulation are indeed enriched in genes exhibiting nonlinear scaling, in concert with our model.},

This study focused on the functions of Elm1, Sak1, and Tos3, which are three upstream protein kinases of Snf1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in response to high-glucose and heat shock stresses. Results suggested that changing the gene dosage of ELM1/SAK1/TOS3 had different effects under high-glucose and heat shock stresses. ELM1 and SAK1 overexpressions could enhance the tolerance of S. cerevisiae to high-glucose and heat shock stresses, respectively. Nevertheless, the overexpression of TOS3 decreased the tolerance to high-glucose stress, and a native level of Tos3 was important for the normal adaptation to heat shock condition. The overexpression of ELM1 increased the accumulation of trehalose and ergosterol and altered the composition of fatty acids with altered gene expressions involved in the metabolism of three metabolites. Enhanced resistance to heat shock stress in SAK1 overexpression might be related to the enhanced accumulation of trehalose and ergosterol and upregulated transcription of genes related to the metabolism of trehalose and ergosterol. Furthermore, Elm1 might regulate the metabolism of trehalose, ergosterol, and fatty acids in a Snf1-independent form under high-glucose stress. A Snf1-independent pathway might be involved in the regulation of trehalose metabolism by Sak1 under heat shock condition. However, Sak1 and Snf1 may have an indirect relationship in the regulation of ergosterol synthesis.},

The single-cell transcriptome analysis also highlighted key biological processes or cellular components, including oxidation\textendash reduction process, oxidative stress response (OSR), translation, ribosome biogenesis and mitochondrion that underlie aging in yeast. We uncovered a molecular marker of FIT3, indicating the early heterogeneity during aging in yeast. We also analyzed the regulation of transcription factors and further characterized the distinctive temporal regulation of the OSR by YAP1 and proteasome activity by RPN4 during aging in yeast. Overall, our data profoundly reveal early heterogeneity during aging in yeast and shed light on the aging dynamics at the single cell level.},

Such statistical feature extraction also serves as a dimension-reduction procedure for multivariate time series. We demonstrate the effectiveness and simplicity of our proposed method by clustering human motion sequences: dynamic and high-dimensional multivariate time series. The proposed method based on univariate time series structure and statistical metrics provides a novel, yet simple and flexible way to cluster multivariate time series data efficiently with promising accuracy. The success of our method on the case study suggests that clustering may be a valuable addition to the tools available for human motion pattern recognition research.},

High levels of ROS can trigger cell death, whereas lower levels drive diverse and important cellular functions. We show here by employing a newly developed mitochondrial matrix-targeted superoxide indicator, that individual mitochondria undergo~spontaneous bursts of superoxide generation, termed ``superoxide flashes.'' Superoxide flashes occur randomly in space and time, exhibit all-or-none properties, and provide a vital source of superoxide production across many different cell types. Individual flashes are triggered by transient openings of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore stimulating superoxide production by the ETC. Furthermore, we observe a flurry of superoxide flash activity during reoxygenation of cardiomyocytes after hypoxia, which is inhibited by the cardioprotective compound adenosine. We propose that superoxide flashes could serve as a valuable biomarker for a wide variety of oxidative stress-related diseases.},

However, certain sequence features are not evident in the time domain and the human brain can extract visual features based on visualization to classify data. Therefore, some researchers have converted TS data to image data and used image processing methods for TSC. While human perceptionconsists of a combination of human senses from different aspects, existing methods only use sequence features or visualization features. Therefore, this paper proposes a framework for TSC based on fusion features (TSC-FF) of sequence features extracted from raw TS and visualization features extracted from Area Graphs converted from TS. Deep learning methods have been proven to be useful tools for automatically learning features from data; therefore, we use long short-term memory with an attention mechanism (LSTM-A) to learn sequence features and a convolutional neural network with an attention mechanism (CNN-A) for visualization features, in order to imitate the human brain. In addition, we use the simplest visualization method of Area Graph for visualization features extraction, avoiding loss of information and additional computational cost. This article aims to prove that using deep neural networks to learn features from different aspects and fusing them can replace complex, artificially constructed features, as well as remove the bias due to manually designed features, in order to avoid the limitations of domain knowledge. Experiments on several open data sets show that the framework achieves promising results, compared with other methods.},

Increased understanding of cellular responses to sodium acetate would improve our understanding of how cells respond not only to different stimuli but also to composite stresses induced by multiple components (e.g., sodium and acetate) simultaneously. Moreover, unraveling the characteristics of specific stresses under industrially related conditions and the cellular responses evoked by these stresses would be a key factor in the industrial yeast strain engineering toward the increased productivity of not only bioethanol but also advanced biofuels and valuable chemicals that will be in demand in the coming era of bio-based industry.},

  abstract = {Metabolism is inherently stochastic at the cellular level. Whether cells actively regulate processes in response to these random internal variations is a fundamental problem that remains unaddressed, yet critical to understanding biological homeostasis. Here, we show that in E. coli cells, expression of the main catabolic enzymes is continuously adjusted in response to metabolic fluctuations under constant external conditions. This noise feedback is performed by the cAMP-CRP system, which controls transcription of the catabolic enzymes by modulating concentrations of the second messenger cAMP upon changes in metabolite abundance. Using time-lapse microscopy, genetic constructs that selectively disable cAMP-CRP noise feedback, and mathematical modelling, we show how fluctuations circulate through this hybrid metabolic-genetic network at sub cell-cycle timescales. This circulation of stochastic fluctuations is explained by four distinct noise propagation modes, one of which describes the continuous cAMP-CRP regulation. The model successfully predicts how noise circulation is impacted by C-sector under and over-expression. The results raise the question whether the cAMP-CRP system, as well as other metabolic regulation mechanisms, have evolved to manage internal metabolic fluctuations in addition to external growth conditions. We conjecture that second messengers may broadly function to control metabolic stochasticity and achieve cellular homeostasis.},

In microbes, for example, we now know that gene expression across the whole genome typically changes with growth rate. The mechanisms driving such global regulation, however, are not well understood. Here we consider three trade-offs that, because of limitations in levels of cellular energy, free ribosomes, and proteins, are faced by all living cells and we construct a mechanistic model that comprises these trade-offs. Our model couples gene expression with growth rate and growth rate with a growing population of cells. We show that the model recovers Monod's law for the growth of microbes and two other empirical relationships connecting growth rate to the mass fraction of ribosomes. Further, we can explain growth-related effects in dosage compensation by paralogs and predict host\textendash circuit interactions in synthetic biology. Simulating competitions between strains, we find that the regulation of metabolic pathways may have evolved not to match expression of enzymes to levels of extracellular substrates in changing environments but rather to balance a trade-off between exploiting one type of nutrient over another. Although coarse-grained, the trade-offs that the model embodies are fundamental, and, as such, our modeling framework has potentially wide application, including in both biotechnology and medicine.},

  abstract = {Bioluminescence techniques allow accurate monitoring of the circadian clock in single cells. We have analyzed bioluminescence data of Per gene expression in mouse SCN neurons and fibroblasts. From these data, we extracted parameters such as damping rate and noise intensity using two simple mathematical models, one describing a damped oscillator driven by noise, and one describing a self-sustained noisy oscillator. Both models describe the data well and enabled us to quantitatively characterize both wild-type cells and several mutants. It has been suggested that the circadian clock is self-sustained at the single cell level, but we conclude that present data are not sufficient to determine whether the circadian clock of single SCN neurons and fibroblasts is a damped or a self-sustained oscillator. We show how to settle this question, however, by testing the models' predictions of different phases and amplitudes in response to a periodic entrainment signal (zeitgeber).},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Microarray experiments are now routinely used to collect large-scale time series data, for example to monitor gene expression during the cell cycle. Statistical analysis of this data poses many challenges, one being that it is hard to identify correctly the subset of genes with a clear periodic signature. This has lead to a controversial argument with regard to the suitability of both available methods and current microarray data. METHODS: We introduce two simple but efficient statistical methods for signal detection and gene selection in gene expression time series data. First, we suggest the average periodogram as an exploratory device for graphical assessment of the presence of periodic transcripts in the data. Second, we describe an exact statistical test to identify periodically expressed genes that allows one to distinguish periodic from purely random processes. This identification method is based on the so-called g-statistic and uses the false discovery rate approach to multiple testing. RESULTS: Using simulated data it is shown that the suggested method is capable of identifying cell-cycle-activated genes in a gene expression data set even if the number of the cyclic genes is very small and regardless the presence of a dominant non-periodic component in the data. Subsequently, we re-examine 12 large microarray time series data sets (in part controversially discussed) from yeast, human fibroblast, human HeLa and bacterial cells. Based on the statistical analysis it is found that a majority of these data sets contained little or no statistical significant evidence for genes with periodic variation linked to cell cycle regulation. On the other hand, for the remaining data the method extends the catalog of previously known cell-cycle-specific transcripts by identifying additional periodic genes not found by other methods. The problem of distinguishing periodicity due to generic cell cycle activity and to artifacts from synchronization is also discussed. AVAILABILITY: The approach has been implemented in the R package GeneTS available from http://www.stat.uni-muenchen.de/\textasciitilde strimmer/software.html under the terms of the GNU General Public License.},

  abstract = {Endogenous circadian clocks control the rhythmicity of a broad range of behavioral and physiological processes, and this is entrained by the daily fluctuations in light and dark. Nocturnin (Noct) is a rhythmically expressed gene regulated by the circadian clock that belongs to the CCR4 family of endonuclease\textendash exonuclease\textendash phosphatase (EEP) enzymes, and the NOCT protein exhibits phosphatase activity, catalyzing the removal of the 2{${'}$}-phosphate from NADP(H). In addition to its daily nighttime peak of expression, it is also induced by acute stimuli. Loss of Nocturnin (Noct\textendash/-) in mice results in resistance to high-fat diet-induced obesity, and loss of Noct in HEK293T cells confers a protective effect to oxidative stress. Modeling of the full-length Nocturnin protein reveals a partially structured amino terminus that is disparate from its CCR4 family members. The high sequence conservation of a leucine zipper-like (LZ-like) motif, the only structural element in the amino terminus, highlights the potential importance of this domain in modulating phosphatase activity. In vitro biochemical and biophysical techniques demonstrate that the LZ-like domain within the flexible N-terminus is necessary for preserving the active site cleft in an optimal conformation to promote the efficient turnover of the substrate. This modulation occurs in cis and is pivotal in maintaining the stability and conformational integrity of the enzyme. These new findings suggest an additional layer of modulating the activity of Nocturnin in addition to its rhythmicity to provide fine-tuned control over cellular levels of NADPH.},

  abstract = {Metabolic models are typically characterized by a large number of parameters. Traditionally, metabolic control analysis is applied to differential equation-based models to investigate the sensitivity of predictions to parameters. A corresponding theory for constraint-based models is lacking, due to their formulation as optimization problems. Here, we show that optimal solutions of optimization problems can be efficiently differentiated using constrained optimization duality and implicit differentiation. We use this to calculate the sensitivities of predicted reaction fluxes and enzyme concentrations to turnover numbers in an enzyme-constrained metabolic model of Escherichia coli. The sensitivities quantitatively identify rate limiting enzymes and are mathematically precise, unlike current finite difference based approaches used for sensitivity analysis. Further, efficient differentiation of constraint-based models unlocks the ability to use gradient information for parameter estimation. We demonstrate this by improving, genome-wide, the state-of-the-art turnover number estimates for E. coli. Finally, we show that this technique can be generalized to arbitrarily complex models. By differentiating the optimal solution of a model incorporating both thermodynamic and kinetic rate equations, the effect of metabolite concentrations on biomass growth can be elucidated. We benchmark these metabolite sensitivities against a large experimental gene knockdown study, and find good alignment between the predicted sensitivities and in vivo metabolome changes. In sum, we demonstrate several applications of differentiating optimal solutions of constraint-based metabolic models, and show how it connects to classic metabolic control analysis.},

Pcl10p is one of four Pcls with little sequence similarity to cyclins involved in cell cycle control. It has been implicated in specifying the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase (Gsy2p). We report that recombinant Pho85p and Pcl10p produced in Escherichia coli reconstitute an active Gsy2p kinase in vitro. Gsy2p phosphorylation required Pcl10p, occurred at physiologically relevant sites, and resulted in inactivation of Gsy2p. The activity of the reconstituted enzyme was even greater than Pho85p-Pcl10p isolated from yeast, and we conclude that, unlike many Cdks, Pho85p does not require phosphorylation for activity. Pcl10p formed complexes with Gsy2p, as judged by (i) gel filtration of recombinant Pcl10p and Gsy2p, (ii) coimmunoprecipitation from yeast cell lysates, and (iii) enzyme kinetic behavior consistent with Pcl10p binding the substrate. Synthetic peptides modeled on the sequences of known Pho85p sites were poor substrates with high Km values, and we propose that Pcl10p-Gsy2p interaction is important for substrate selection. Gel filtration of yeast cell lysates demonstrated that most Pho85p was present as a monomer, although a portion coeluted in high-molecular-weight fractions with Pcl10p and Gsy2p. Overexpression of Pcl10p sequestered most of the Pho85p into association with Pcl10p. We suggest a model for Pho85p function in the cell whereby cyclins like Pcl10p recruit Pho85p from a pool of monomers, both activating the kinase and targeting it to substrate.},

  abstract = {From cell division to heartbeat, clocklike rhythms pervade the activities of every living organism. The cycles of life are ultimately biochemical in mechanism but many of the principles that dominate their orchestration are essentially mathematical. The Geometry of Biological Time describes periodic processes in living systems and their non-living analogues in the abstract terms of nonlinear dynamics. Enphasis is given in phase singularities, waves, and mutual synchronization in tissues composed of many clocklike units. Also provided are descriptions of the best-studied experimental systems such as chemical oscillators, pacemaker neurons, circadian clocks, and excitable media organized into biochemical and bioelectrical wave patterns in two and three dimensions. No theoretical background is assumed; the required notions are introduced through an extensive collection of pictures and easily understood examples. This extensively updated new edition incorporates the fruits of two decades' further exploration guided by the same principles. Limit cycle theories of circadian clocks are now applied to human jet lag and are understood in terms of the molecular genetics of their recently discovered mechanisms. Supercomputers reveal the unforeseen architecture and dynamics of three-dimensional scroll waves in excitable media. Their role in life-threatening electrical aberrations of the heartbeat is exposed by laboratory experiments and corroborated in the clinic. These developments trace back to three basic mathematical ideas.},

Estimation of individual body time (circadian phase) is therefore highly relevant for individual optimization of behavior (sleep, meals, sports), diagnostic sampling, medical treatment, and for treatment of circadian rhythm disorders. Here, we provide a partial least squares regression (PLSR) machine learning approach that uses plasma-derived metabolomics data in one or more samples to estimate dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) as a proxy for circadian phase of the human body. For this purpose, our protocol was aimed to stay close to real-life conditions. We found that a metabolomics approach optimized for either women or men under entrained conditions performed equally well or better than existing approaches using more labor-intensive RNA sequencing-based methods. Although estimation of circadian body time using blood-targeted metabolomics requires further validation in shift work and other real-world conditions, it currently may offer a robust, feasible technique with relatively high accuracy to aid personalized optimization of behavior and clinical treatment after appropriate validation in patient populations.},

We find the repressor operates in clusters, which upon extracellular signal detection, translocate from the cytoplasm, bind to nuclear targets and turnover. Simulations of Mig1 configuration within a 3D yeast genome model combined with a promoter-specific, fluorescent translation reporter confirmed clusters are the functional unit of gene regulation. In vitro and structural analysis on reconstituted Mig1 suggests that clusters are stabilized by depletion forces between intrinsically disordered sequences.

We examined citramalate production in Escherichia coli expressing the citramalate synthase gene cimA. Although, knockouts in ldhA coding lactate dehydrogenase and glcB/aceB coding malate synthase did not benefit citramalate accumulation, knockouts in gltA coding citrate synthase, and ackA coding acetate kinase significantly increased citramalate accumulation compared to the control strain. A fed-batch process in a controlled fermenter using a glucose feed resulted in 46.5\,g/L citramalate in 132\,h with a yield of 0.63\,g/g, over 75\% of the theoretical maximum yield from glucose of 0.82\,g/g.

  abstract = {Recent single-cell studies have revealed that yeast stress response involves transcription factors that are activated in pulses. However, it remains unclear whether and how these dynamic transcription factors temporally interact to regulate stress survival. Here we show that budding yeast cells can exploit the temporal relationship between paralogous general stress regulators, Msn2 and Msn4, during stress response. We find that individual pulses of Msn2 and Msn4 are largely redundant, and cells can enhance the expression of their shared targets by increasing their temporal divergence. Thus, functional redundancy between these two paralogs is modulated in a dynamic manner to confer fitness advantages for yeast cells, which might feed back to promote the preservation of their redundancy. This evolutionary implication is supported by evidence from Msn2/Msn4 orthologs and analyses of other transcription factor paralogs. Together, we show a cell fate control mechanism through temporal redundancy modulation in yeast, which may represent an evolutionarily important strategy for maintaining functional redundancy between gene duplicates.},

Here, we carried out a multi-omics analysis of S. cerevisiae undergoing a specific growth rate transition from 0.2 h\textendash 1 to 0.35 h\textendash 1. The extracellular metabolome, the transcriptome and the proteome were analyzed in an 8-hour transition period after the specific growth rate shifted from 0.2 h\textendash 1 to 0.35 h\textendash 1. The changing trends of both the transcriptome and proteome were analyzed using principal component analysis, which showed that the transcriptome clustered together after 60 min, while the proteome reached steady-state much later. Focusing on central carbon metabolism, we analyzed both the changes in the transcriptome and proteome, and observed an interesting changing pattern in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) pathway, which indicates an important role for citric acid shuttling across the mitochondrial membrane for {$\alpha$}-ketoglutarate accumulation during the transition from respiratory to respiro-fermentative metabolism. This was supported by a change in the oxaloacetate and malate shuttle. Together, our findings shed new light into the onset of the Crabtree effect in S. cerevisiae.},

Under different light conditions, changes in the rhythmic behavior of organisms are observed. When exposed to constant light, amplitude suppression was observed in wild-type strains of the microbe Neurospora, whereas the period of the circadian rhythms was shortened in vivid strains. In this study, an explanation was given for these observations by the Goodwin model. It is assumed that the degradation rate of the circadian oscillator in Neurospora differs between strains. We found that with a lower degradation rate, the larger constant light intensity leads to the suppression of amplitude. The low or moderate degradation rate results in a negative relationship between the oscillator period and constant light intensity. In addition, the analytical solutions explored by the asymptotic techniques confirmed our simulation results. This article sheds light on the mechanisms of light affecting the circadian clock as well as the analytical solutions were exhibited for both the period and the amplitude of the clock.},

Microorganisms increase their mutation rate when stressed, perhaps addressing the growing need for evolutionary innovation. Such a strategy, however, is only beneficial under moderate stresses that allow cells to divide and realize their mutagenic potential. In contrast, severe stresses rapidly kill the majority of the population with the exception of a small minority of cells that are in a phenotypically distinct state termed persistence. Although persisters were discovered many decades ago, the stochastic event triggering persistence is poorly understood. We report that spontaneous DNA damage triggers persistence in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by activating the general stress response, providing protection against a range of harsh stress and drug environments. We further show that the persister subpopulation carries an increased load of genetic variants in the form of insertions, deletions or large structural variations, which are unrelated to their stress survival. This coupling of DNA damage to phenotypic persistence may increase genetic diversity specifically in severe stress conditions, where diversity is beneficial but the ability to generate de novo mutations is limited.},

This boils down to deciding the consistency of a system of polynomial inequalities over the reals, which is challenging to solve from an analytical perspective, and out of reach even for traditional computational software designed to solve such problems.

Jojima, M. Fujii, E. Mori, M. Inui, and H. Yukawa, Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 87:159\textendash 165, 2010). In this study, we employ stepwise overexpression and chromosomal integration of a total of four genes encoding glycolytic enzymes (herein referred to as glycolytic genes) to demonstrate further successive improvements in C. glutamicum glucose metabolism under oxygen deprivation. In addition to gapA, overexpressing pyruvate kinase-encoding pyk and phosphofructokinase-encoding pfk enabled strain GLY2/pCRD500 to realize respective 13\% and 20\% improved rates of glucose consumption and alanine formation compared to GLY1/pCRD500. Subsequent overexpression of glucose-6-phosphate isomerase-encoding gpi in strain GLY3/pCRD500 further improved its glucose metabolism. Notably, both alanine productivity and yield increased after each overexpression step. After 48 h of incubation, GLY3/pCRD500 produced 2,430 mM alanine at a yield of 91.8\%. This was 6.4-fold higher productivity than that of the wild-type strain. Intracellular metabolite analysis showed that gapA overexpression led to a decreased concentration of metabolites upstream of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, suggesting that the overexpression resolved a bottleneck in glycolysis. Changing ratios of the extracellular metabolites by overexpression of glycolytic genes resulted in reduction of the intracellular NADH/NAD+ ratio, which also plays an important role on the improvement of glucose consumption. Enhanced alanine dehydrogenase activity using a high-copy-number plasmid further accelerated the overall alanine productivity. Increase in glycolytic enzyme activities is a promising approach to make drastic progress in growth-arrested bioprocesses.},

We performed integrative evolution analysis to investigate how genomic evolution determines trait generation by reconstructing genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) for 332 yeasts. These GEMs could comprehensively characterize trait diversity and predict enzyme functionality, thereby signifying that sequence-level evolution has shaped reaction networks towards new metabolic functions. Strikingly, using GEMs, we can mechanistically map different evolutionary events, e.g. horizontal gene transfer and gene duplication, onto relevant subpathways to explain metabolic plasticity. This demonstrates that gene family expansion and enzyme promiscuity are prominent mechanisms for metabolic trait gains, while GEM simulations reveal that additional factors, such as gene loss from distant pathways, contribute to trait losses. Furthermore, our analysis could pinpoint to specific genes and pathways that have been under positive selection and relevant for the formulation of complex metabolic traits, i.e. thermotolerance and the Crabtree effect. Our findings illustrate how multidimensional evolution in both metabolic network structure and individual enzymes drives phenotypic variations.},

The induction of phospholipid biosynthetic genes is accompanied by induction of the enzyme that hydrolyzes S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), a product and inhibitor of methyltransferases. Beyond its function for the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC), the methylation of PE facilitates the turnover of SAM for the synthesis of cysteine and glutathione through transsulfuration. Strikingly, cells that lack PE methylation accumulate SAM, which leads to hypermethylation of histones and the major phosphatase PP2A, dependency on cysteine, and sensitivity to oxidative stress. Without PE methylation, particular sites on histones then become methyl sinks to enable the conversion of SAM to SAH. These findings reveal an unforeseen metabolic function for phospholipid and histone methylation intrinsic to the life of a cell.},

First, salt tolerance, cell wall integrity and cell cycle phenotypes of Ppz mutants are dependent on the Trk K+ transporters. Secondly, Ppz mutants exhibit altered activity of the Trk system, as measured by rubidium uptake. Thirdly, Ppz mutants exhibit altered intracellular K+ and pH, as expected from H+ efflux providing electrical balance during K+ uptake. Our unifying picture of Ppz phenotypes contends that activation of Trk by decreased Ppz activity results in plasma membrane depolarization (reducing uptake of toxic cations), increased intracellular K+ and turgor (compromising cell integrity), and increased intracellular pH (augmenting the expression of pH-regulated genes and facilitating {$\alpha$}-factor recovery). In addition to providing a coherent explanation for all Ppz-dependent phenotypes, our results provide evidence for a causal relationship between intracellular cation homeostasis and a potential cell cycle checkpoint.},

To maintain cellular homeostasis and prevent pathologies, the induction and amplitude of autophagy activity are finely controlled through regulation of ATG gene expression. Here we report that the Ccr4-Not complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has bidirectional roles in regulating autophagy before and after nutrient deprivation. Under nutrient-rich conditions, Ccr4-Not directly targets the mRNAs of several ATG genes in the core autophagy machinery to promote their degradation through deadenylation, thus contributing to maintaining autophagy at the basal level. Upon starvation, Ccr4-Not releases its repression of these ATG genes and switches its role to promote the expression of a different subset of ATG genes, which is required for sufficient autophagy induction and activity.

As such, ME1 has been implicated in the progression of cancers and has received attention as a promising drug target. Here we report the identification of a novel small-molecule inhibitor of ME1, designated AS1134900. AS1134900 is highly selective for ME1 compared with ME2 and uncompetitively inhibits ME1 activity in the presence of its substrates NADP+ and malate. In addition, X-ray crystal structure analysis of the enzyme\textendash inhibitor complex revealed that AS1134900 binds outside the ME1 active site in a novel allosteric site. Structural comparison of the ME1 quaternary complex with AS1134900, NADPH, and Mn2+, alongside known crystal structures of malic enzymes, indicated the determined crystal ME1\textendash inhibitor complex is in the open form conformation. These results provide insights and a starting point for further discovery of drugs that inhibit ME1 activity in cancer cells.},

With this approach, free fatty acid yield reached 40\% of theoretical yield, which is the highest yield reported for Saccharomyces cerevisiae to our knowledge. This study reports the implementation of a synthetic decarboxylation cycle in the yeast cytosol, and its application in achieving high yields of valuable chemicals in cell factories.

Genes in central carbon metabolism, however, are distinctly regulated and do not respond to the cell growth rate or nitrogen metabolism as all other genes. Understanding these effects allows the confounding factors of growth rate and metabolism to be accounted for in gene expression profiling studies.},

However, spectral entropy is invariant under the permutation of the power spectrum estimations on a predefined grid. This erases the inherent order structure in the spectrum. To disentangle the order structure and extract meaningful information from raw digital signal, a novel analysis method is necessary. In this paper, we tried to unfold this order structure by defining descriptors mapping real- and vector-valued power spectrum estimation of a signal into a scalar value. The proposed descriptors showed its potential in diverse problems. Significant differences were observed from brain signals and surface electromyography of different pathological/physiological states. Drastic change accompanied by the alteration of the underlying process of signals enables it as a candidate feature for seizure detection and endpoint detection in speech signal. Since the order structure in the spectrum of physiological signal carries previously ignored information, which cannot be properly extracted by existing techniques, this paper takes one step forward along this direction by proposing computationally efficient descriptors with guaranteed information gain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work revealing the effectiveness of the order structure in the spectrum in physiological signal processing.},

After an order parameter, r, is defined, it can be derived how \textbackslash (r=0\textbackslash ) for \textbackslash (T{$>$}T\_c\textbackslash ) and how \textbackslash (r \textbackslash propto (T\_c - T)\^\textbackslash gamma \textbackslash ) at lowest order for \textbackslash (T {$<$} T\_c\textbackslash ). Here T is the temperature and \textbackslash (T\_c\textbackslash ) represents a critical temperature. The value of \textbackslash (\textbackslash gamma \textbackslash ) appears to not depend on physical details of the system, but very much on dimensionality. No phase transitions exist for one-dimensional systems. For systems of four or more dimensions, each unit is interacting with sufficiently many neighbors to warrant a mean-field approach. The mean-field approximation leads to \textbackslash (\textbackslash gamma = 1/2\textbackslash ). In this article we formulate a realistic, nonequilibrium system of coupled oscillators. Each oscillator moves forward through a cyclic 1D array of n states and the rate at which an oscillator proceeds from state i to state \textbackslash (i+1\textbackslash ) depends on the populations in states \textbackslash (i+1\textbackslash ) and \textbackslash (i-1\textbackslash ). We study how the phase transitions occur from a homogeneous distribution over the states to a clustered distribution. A clustered distribution means that oscillators have synchronized. We define an order parameter and we find that the critical exponent takes on the mean-field value of 1/2 for any number of states n. However, as n increases, the phase transition occurs for ever smaller values of \textbackslash (T\_c\textbackslash ). We present rigorous mathematics and simple approximations to develop an understanding of the phase transitions in this system. We explain why and how the critical exponent value of 1/2 is expected to be robust and we discuss a wet-lab experimental setup to substantiate our findings.},

The process leading to fission is viewed as an unequal flow of sentiments and information across the ties in a social network. This flow is unequal because it is uniquely constrained by the contextual range and sensitivity of each relationship in the network. The subsequent differential sharing of sentiments leads to the formation of subgroups with more internal stability than the group as a whole, and results in fission. The Ford-Fulkerson labeling algorithm allows an accurate prediction of membership in the subgroups and of the locus of the fission to be made from measurements of the potential for information flow across each edge in the network. Methods for measurement of potential information flow are discussed, and it is shown that all appropriate techniques will generate the same predictions.},

An understanding of the acetic acid tolerance mechanisms is pivotal for the industrial production of bioethanol. One of the mechanisms for acetic acid tolerance is transporter-mediated secretion where individual transporters have been implicated. Here, we deleted the transporters Aqr1, Tpo2, and Tpo3, in various combinations, to investigate their combined role in acetic acid tolerance. Single transporter deletions did not impact the tolerance at mild acetic acid stress (20 mM), but at severe stress (50 mM) growth was decreased or impaired. Tpo2 plays a crucial role in acetic acid tolerance, while the AQR1 deletion has a least effect on growth and acetate efflux.. Deletion of both Tpo2 and Tpo3 enhanced the severe growth defects at 20 mM acetic acid concomitantly with a reduced rate of acetate secretion, while TPO2 and/or TPO3 overexpression in {$\increment$}tpo2{$\increment$}tpo3{$\increment$} restored the tolerance. In the deletion strains, the acetate derived from sugar metabolism accumulated intracellularly, while gene expression analysis suggests that under these conditions, ethanol metabolism is activated while acetic acid production is reduced. The data demonstrate that Tpo2 and Tpo3 together fulfil an important role in acetate efflux and the acetic acid response.},

Besides enhancing inherent peroxisomal fatty acids {$\beta$}-oxidation cycle, a novel heterologous cytosolic fatty acids {$\beta$}-oxidation pathway was constructed, and this resulted in an increased production of MK by 2-fold. To increase carbon fluxes to methyl ketones, the supply of precursors was enhanced by engineering lipid metabolism, including improving the intracellular biosynthesis of acyl-CoAs, weakening the consumption of acyl-CoAs for lipids storage, and reinforcing activation of free fatty acids to acyl-CoAs. Hereby the titer of MK was improved by 7-fold, reaching 143.72~mg/L. Finally, transcription factor engineering was employed to increase the biosynthesis of methyl ketones and it was found that overexpression of ADR1 can mimic the oleate activated biogenesis and proliferation of peroxisomes, which resulted in a further increased production of MK by 28\%. With these modifications and optimization, up to 845~mg/L total MK were produced from glucose in fed-batch fermentation, which is the highest titer of methyl ketones reported produced by fungi.},

To investigate such heterogeneity, experimental methods to zoom into the metabolism of individual cells are required. To this end, the autofluoresence of the redox cofactors NADH and NADPH offers great potential for single-cell dynamic NAD(P)H measurements. However, NAD(P)H excitation requires UV light, which can cause cell damage. In this work, we developed a method for time-lapse NAD(P)H imaging in single E. coli cells. Our method combines a setup with reduced background emission, UV-enhanced microscopy equipment and optimized exposure settings, overall generating acceptable NAD(P)H signals from single cells, with minimal negative effect on cell growth. Through different experiments, in which we perturb E. coli's redox metabolism, we demonstrated that the acquired fluorescence signal indeed corresponds to NAD(P)H. Using this new method, for the first time, we report that intracellular NAD(P)H levels oscillate along the bacterial cell division cycle. The developed method for dynamic measurement of NAD(P)H in single bacterial cells will be an important tool to zoom into metabolism of individual cells.},

  abstract = {Many cellular processes are governed by stochastic reaction events. These events do not necessarily occur in single steps of individual molecules, and, conversely, each birth or death of a macromolecule (e.g., protein) could involve several small reaction steps, creating a memory between individual events and thus leading to nonmarkovian reaction kinetics. Characterizing this kinetics is challenging. Here, we develop a systematic approach for a general reaction network with arbitrary intrinsic waiting-time distributions, which includes the stationary generalized chemical-master equation (sgCME), the stationary generalized Fokker\textendash Planck equation, and the generalized linear-noise approximation. The first formulation converts a nonmarkovian issue into a markovian one by introducing effective transition rates (that explicitly decode the effect of molecular memory) for the reactions in an equivalent reaction network with the same substrates but without molecular memory. Nonmarkovian features of the reaction kinetics can be revealed by solving the sgCME. The latter 2 formulations can be used in the fast evaluation of fluctuations. These formulations can have broad applications, and, in particular, they may help us discover new biological knowledge underlying memory effects. When they are applied to generalized stochastic models of gene-expression regulation, we find that molecular memory is in effect equivalent to a feedback and can induce bimodality, fine-tune the expression noise, and induce switch.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The coordination of metabolism and growth with cell division is crucial for proliferation. While it has long been known that cell metabolism regulates the cell division cycle, it is becoming increasingly clear that the cell division cycle also regulates metabolism. In budding yeast, we previously showed that over half of all measured metabolites change concentration through the cell cycle indicating that metabolic fluxes are extensively regulated during cell cycle progression. However, how this regulation is achieved still remains poorly understood. Since both the cell cycle and metabolism are regulated to a large extent by protein phosphorylation, we here decided to measure the phosphoproteome through the budding yeast cell cycle. Specifically, we chose a cell cycle synchronisation strategy that avoids stress and nutrient-related perturbations of metabolism, and we grew the yeast on ethanol minimal medium to force cells to utilize their full biosynthetic repertoire. Using a tandem-mass-tagging approach, we found over 200 sites on metabolic enzymes and transporters to be phospho-regulated. These sites were distributed among many pathways including carbohydrate catabolism, lipid metabolism and amino acid synthesis and therefore likely contribute to changing metabolic fluxes through the cell cycle. Among all one thousand sites whose phosphorylation increases through the cell cycle, the CDK consensus motif and an arginine-directed motif were highly enriched. This arginine-directed R-R-x-S motif is associated with protein-kinase A, which regulates metabolism and promotes growth. Finally, we also found over one thousand sites that are dephosphorylated through the G1/S transition. We speculate that the phosphatase Glc7/ PP1, known to regulate both the cell cycle and carbon metabolism, may play an important role because its regulatory subunits are phospho-regulated in our data. In summary, our results identify extensive cell cycle dependent phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of metabolic enzymes and suggest multiple mechanisms through which the cell division cycle regulates metabolic signalling pathways to temporally coordinate biosynthesis with distinct phases of the cell division cycle.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Its performance is greatly affected by its parameters. Generally, parameter control strategies involve determining the most suitable value for the current state; there is only a little research on parameter combination and parameter distribution which is also useful for improving algorithm performance. This paper proposes an idea to use parameter region division and parameter strategy combination to flexibly adjust the parameter distribution. Based on the idea, a group-based two-level parameter combination framework is designed to support various modes of parameter combination, and enrich the parameter distribution characteristics. Under this framework, two customized parameter combination strategies are given for a single-operation DE algorithm and a multi-operation DE algorithm. The experiments verify the effectiveness of the two strategies and it also illustrates the meaning of the framework.},

  abstract = {How transcription programs rapidly adjust to changing metabolic and cellular cues remains poorly defined. Here, we reveal a function for the Yaf9 component of the SWR1-C and NuA4 chromatin regulatory complexes in maintaining timely transcription of metabolic genes across the yeast metabolic cycle (YMC). By reading histone acetylation during the oxidative and respiratory phase of the YMC, Yaf9 recruits SWR1-C and NuA4 complexes to deposit H2A.Z and acetylate H4, respectively. Increased H2A.Z and H4 acetylation during the oxidative phase promotes transcriptional initiation and chromatin machinery occupancy and is associated with reduced RNA polymerase II levels at genes\textemdash a pattern reversed during transition from oxidative to reductive metabolism. Prevention of Yaf9-H3 acetyl reading disrupted this pattern of transcriptional and chromatin regulator recruitment and impaired the timely transcription of metabolic genes. Together, these findings reveal that Yaf9 contributes to a dynamic chromatin and transcription initiation factor signature that is necessary for the proper regulation of metabolic gene transcription during the YMC. They also suggest that unique regulatory mechanisms of transcription exist at distinct metabolic states.},

  abstract = {The respiro-fermentative metabolism in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, also called the Crabtree effect, results in lower energy efficiency and biomass yield which can impact yields of chemicals to be produced using this cell factory. Although it can be engineered to become Crabtree negative, the slow growth and glucose consumption rate limit its industrial application. Here the Crabtree effect in yeast can be alleviated by engineering the transcription factor Mth1 involved in glucose signaling and a subunit of the RNA polymerase II mediator complex Med2. It was found that the mutant with the MTH1A81D\&MED2*432Y allele could grow in glucose rich medium with a specific growth rate of 0.30 h-1, an ethanol yield of 0.10\,g\,g-1, and a biomass yield of 0.21\,g\,g-1, compared with a specific growth rate of 0.40 h-1, an ethanol yield of 0.46\,g\,g-1, and a biomass yield of 0.11\,g\,g-1 in the wild-type strain CEN.PK 113-5D. Transcriptome analysis revealed significant downregulation of the glycolytic process, as well as the upregulation of the TCA cycle and the electron transfer chain. Significant expression changes of several reporter transcription factors were also identified, which might explain the higher energy efficiencies in the engineered strain. We further demonstrated the potential of the engineered strain with the production of 3-hydroxypropionic acid at a titer of 2.04\,g\,L-1, i.e., 5.4-fold higher than that of a reference strain, indicating that the alleviated glucose repression could enhance the supply of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA. These results suggested that the engineered strain could be used as an efficient cell factory for mitochondrial production of acetyl-CoA derived chemicals.},

Recent research found that 2OG acts as a signal in the regulation of nitrogen metabolism in prokaryote. While in eukaryotic cells, 2OG is also attractive since tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) in tumor cells was found to undergo metabolic alterations such as the Warburg effect. A method of tracing this key metabolite 2OG at the cellular level is highly desirable. In order to visualize and monitor 2-oxoglutarate metabolism in single living cells, we developed a novel sensor by inserting the functional 2OG-binding domain GAF of the NifA protein into YFP. This sensor was found to be highly specific to 2OG. Following binding of 2OG, fluorescence intensity of the sensor increased with increasing 2OG concentration and reached a 1.5-fold maximum fluorescence signal change (F/F0-1), kinetics of fluorescence signal upon 2OG association with sensor was fast, the dynamic response range of the mOGsor sensors was 100\textmu M\textendash 100mM. Dissociation between sensor and 2OG was verified both in vitro and in vivo. This sensor reported cellular 2OG dynamics in E. coli cells in real time upon different nutrition challenges and manifested the differences in 2OG pool accumulation and consumption rate.},

Here, we examine the mechanisms and fundamental structure that achieve these properties in the cell cycle of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that this process behaves like an excitable system containing three well-decoupled saddle-node bifurcations to execute DNA replication and mitosis events. The yeast cell-cycle regulatory network can be divided into three modules\textemdash the G1/S phase, early M phase, and late M phase\textemdash wherein both positive feedback loops in each module and interactions among modules play important roles. Specifically, when the cell-cycle process operates near the critical points of the saddle-node bifurcations, a critical slowing down effect takes place. Such interregnum then allows for an attractive manifold and sufficient duration for cell-cycle events, within which to assess the completion of DNA replication and mitosis, e.g., spindle assembly. Moreover, such arrangement ensures that any fluctuation in an early module or event will not transmit to a later module or event. Thus, our results suggest a possible dynamical mechanism of the cell-cycle process to ensure event order and dynamic robustness and give insight into the evolution of eukaryotic cell-cycle processes.},

The concentration of NADP+ in cytoplasm or organelles is dynamic due to its conversion to many important derivatives. To track the NADP+ concentration in single living cells, we developed a genetically encoded NADP+ biosensor by inserting a reporter element, ketopantoate reductase (KPR), between the F\"orster resonance energy transfer (FRET) pair, cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). This recombinant sensor showed a NADP+ concentration-dependent decrease in the fluorescence ratio in vitro assay. In order to optimize this biosensor, we performed peptide-length optimization and site-directed mutagenesis in the binding pocket of KPR guided by predictions from computational protein redesign. This modified biosensor showed a 70\% {$\Delta$}ratio increase compared to the wild type and was found to be highly specific to NADP+, with a detection limit of 1{$\mu$}M. The sensor also reported NADP+ real-time cellular dynamics in Escherichia coli (E. coli) after the addition of its precursor, nicotinic acid (NA). Altogether, these results demonstrate the feasibility of the biosensor for visualizing NADP+ both in vitro and in vivo.},

We surprisingly proved that overexpression of malK could up-regulate the expression of prpD and propanoate metabolism, which leads to increased expression of exogenous genes. More importantly, the overexpression of prpD or malK could arouse a complex set of pyruvate-centered metabolic networks that mainly increase the energy supply (ATP), by-product recycling (acetate), and amino acids for the efficient expression of exogenous genes. This novel theory for promoting the efficient expression of exogenous genes will be useful in a wide range of fields.

There are many different techniques and algorithms for determining period, all with different assumptions and with differing levels of complexity.

We have developed the BioDare system, an online service allowing data-sharing (including public dissemination), data-processing and analysis. Circadian experiments are the main focus of BioDare hence performing period analysis is a major feature of the system. Six methods have been incorporated into BioDare: Enright and Lomb-Scargle periodograms, FFT-NLLS, mFourfit, MESA and Spectrum Resampling. Here we review those six techniques, explain the principles behind each algorithm and evaluate their performance. In order to quantify the methods' accuracy, we examine the algorithms against artificial mathematical test signals and model-generated mRNA data. Our re-implementation of each method in Java allows meaningful comparisons of the computational complexity and computing time associated with each algorithm. Finally, we provide guidelines on which algorithms are most appropriate for which data types, and recommendations on experimental design to extract optimal data for analysis.},

  abstract = {Malignant transformation is often accompanied by significant metabolic changes. To identify drivers underlying these changes, we calculated metabolic flux states for the NCI60 cell line collection and correlated the variance between metabolic states of these lines with their other properties. The analysis revealed a remarkably consistent structure underlying high flux metabolism. The three primary uptake pathways, glucose, glutamine and serine, are each characterized by three features: (1) metabolite uptake sufficient for the stoichiometric requirement to sustain observed growth, (2) overflow metabolism, which scales with excess nutrient uptake over the basal growth requirement, and (3) redox production, which also scales with nutrient uptake but greatly exceeds the requirement for growth. We discovered that resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs in these lines broadly correlates with the amount of glucose uptake. These results support an interpretation of the Warburg effect and glutamine addiction as features of a growth state that provides resistance to metabolic stress through excess redox and energy production. Furthermore, overflow metabolism observed may indicate that mitochondrial catabolic capacity is a key constraint setting an upper limit on the rate of cofactor production possible. These results provide a greater context within which the metabolic alterations in cancer can be understood.},

  abstract = {Circadian clocks are 24-h endogenous oscillators in physiological and behavioral processes. Though recent transcriptomic studies have been successful in revealing the circadian rhythmicity in gene expression, the power calculation for omics circadian analysis have not been fully explored. In this paper, we develop a statistical method, namely CircaPower, to perform power calculation for circadian pattern detection. Our theoretical framework is determined by three key factors in circadian gene detection: sample size, intrinsic effect size and sampling design. Via simulations, we systematically investigate the impact of these key factors on circadian power calculation. We not only demonstrate that CircaPower is fast and accurate, but also show its underlying cosinor model is robust against variety of violations of model assumptions. In real applications, we demonstrate the performance of CircaPower using mouse pan-tissue data and human post-mortem brain data, and illustrate how to perform circadian power calculation using mouse skeleton muscle RNA-Seq pilot as case study. Our method CircaPower has been implemented in an R package, which is made publicly available on GitHub ( https://github.com/circaPower/circaPower).},

  abstract = {While we have a solid understanding about the cell biological and biochemical control aspects of the eukaryotic cell growth and division process, much less is known about the metabolic and biosynthetic dynamics during the cell cycle. Here, we review recent discoveries made at the single-cell and population-level that show that budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) metabolism oscillates in synchrony with the cell cycle in actively dividing cells, as well as independently when the cell cycle is halted. In fact, emerging evidence suggests that the cell cycle-independent metabolic oscillations interact with elements of the cell cycle machinery via several possible mechanisms. Furthermore, recent reports indicate that different biosynthetic processes exhibit temporally changing activity patterns during the cell cycle. Thus, resources are drawn from primary metabolism in a dynamic manner, potentially giving rise to the metabolic oscillations. Finally, we highlight work with mammalian cells indicating that similar metabolic dynamics might also exist in higher eukaryotes.},
