The minimal medium described by \parencite{verduynEffectBenzoicAcid1992} was used unless otherwise stated.
This minimal medium does not contain riboflavin, thus minimising its effect on flavin autofluorescence imaging, and its composition is known and easily controlled.
Specifically, the composition of the carbon source-limiting medium are described in tables~\ref{tab:methods-media-delft}--\ref{tab:methods-media-delft-vitamins}, and the media pH was adjusted to 6.0 before use using potassium hydroxide, or sodium hydroxide for potassium-free media.
For auxotrophic strains, supplements were added according to table~\ref{tab:methods-media-auxotroph}.
Then, a carbon source is added as appropriate to create the growth medium.

\subsection{Single-cell microfluidics}
\label{subsec:methods-microfluidics}

Cells were grown from colonies on solid agar in a liquid culture composed of minimal media formulation appropriate for the experiment, supplements appropriate for the strain's auxotrophy, and a carbon source (glucose or pyruvate) appropriate for the experiment (see Section~\ref{subsec:methods-strains_media}).
% Kevin's OD measurements?
The cells were incubated at \SI{30}{\celsius} for \SI{14}{\hour} (overnight) if the carbon source is glucose or \SI{48}{\hour} if the carbon source is pyruvate.
Subsequently, the cells were diluted so that the resulting culture had an OD\textsubscript{600} of 0.10--0.20, and were then incubated for a further \SI{4}{\hour}.

\begin{figure}

  }
  \label{fig:methods-microfluidics}
\end{figure}

ALCATRAS microfluidics \parencite{craneMicrofluidicSystemStudying2014} devices were then prepared and for an experiment, one device's multiple chambers were filled with growth media supplemented with 0.05\% w/v bovine serum albumin.
Cells were then loaded into the ALCATRAS chambers --- different chambers can house cells from different strains (figure~\ref{fig:methods-microfluidics}).
Syringe pumps containing media were programmed to produce a constant flow of \SI{4}{\micro\litre~\hour^{-1}} into the chambers.
As a consequence, parent cells are held in place within traps, while progeny cells flow out of traps into the outflow after the parents bud.
There are two syringes that can contain different media, and in experiments that require different nutrient conditions at different times, the ALCATRAS system is programmed to switch between the two syringes.
The cells and ALCATRAS chambers were located in an incubation chamber (Oko-labs) that was maintained at \SI{30}{\celsius}.

% Update fluorescence settings
Microscopy was performed using a 60 $\times$ 1.4 NA oil immersion objective (Nikon), and the Nikon Perfect Focus System was used to ensure consistent focus.
X-Y spatial positions were defined for each chamber to maximise spatial coverage of the chamber while ensuring that the microscope takes less time to move positions and capture images than the interval period.
Images were taken every \SI{5}{\minute}, and image acquisition duration varied for each experiment.
Brightfield and flavin images were captured in all strains and mCherry images were additionally captured for the HTB2::mCherry strain.
Five z-slices were taken for brightfield images, with a spacing of \SI{0.6}{\micro\metre} between slices.
Fluorescence imaging was performed with an OptoLED light source (Cain Research), and LED voltage was optimised for maximum signal intensity without LED cut-off prior to experiments.
For flavin imaging, the excitation filter was set to 430/24 (\SIrange{418}{442}{\nano\metre}), the emission filter was set to 535/30 (\SIrange{520}{550}{\nano\metre}), and the exposure time was \SI{60}{\milli\second}.
One z-slice was taken for each flavin image in each position.
For mCherry imaging, the excitation filter was set to \SIrange{555}{590}{\nano\metre}), the emission filter was to set to 632/60 (\SIrange{602}{682}{\nano\metre}) and the exposure time was \SI{100}{\milli\second}.
Five z-slices were taken for mCherry images, with a spacing of \SI{0.6}{\micro\metre} between slices.

\section{Image analysis methods}
\label{sec:methods-segmentation}

I used \textit{aliby} \parencite{munozgonzalezPhenotypingSingleCells2023}, an end-to-end Python-based software package developed for time-lapse microscopy, to process the microscope images in order to obtain flavin and mCherry time series for further analysis.

\textit{aliby} tracks tiles that correspond to a trap across time-lapse images to account for expected spatial drifting in the microscope.
It then uses \textit{BABY} \parencite{pietschDeterminingGrowthRates2023} to segment the images of traps to identify the outlines of cells and to track cells from one time point to another, creating a lineage of cells.
\textit{aliby} then overlays the cell outlines onto the fluorescence (flavin and mCherry) images to extract fluorescence intensity, and assigns a fluorescence value to each cell at each time point based on the mean intensity of pixels within the cell's outline.
The background fluorescence is also computed, based on the pixel intensity outside cell outlines, and is then subtracted from the cell fluorescence.
Flavin fluorescence thus represents the oxidation of flavins throughout the yeast metabolic cycle (see section~\ref{sec:intro-flavin}), and mCherry fluorescence thus represents the amount of histone proteins as a proxy for cell division cycle progression \parencite{garmendia-torresMultipleInputsEnsure2018}.

\section{Computational methods}
\label{sec:methods-computational}

\subsection{Precision and recall}
\label{subsec:methods-computational-precision-recall}

To evaluate the performance of rhythmicity detection methods, precision and recall are computed.
The rhythmicity detection methods are seen as a binary classifier that predicts a `positive' or `negative' label to each observation, and these predicted labels are compared against true labels --- in the context of this thesis, manually-defined labels of whether a time series is oscillatory or not.

Given the confusion matrix:

\begin{table}[h]

  % https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/20295
  \begin{tabular}{l|l|c|c|c}
    \multicolumn{2}{c}{}&\multicolumn{2}{c}{Predicted labels}&\\
    \cline{3-4}
    \multicolumn{2}{c|}{}&Positive&Negative&\multicolumn{1}{c}{}\\
    \cline{2-4}
    \multirow{2}{*}{True labels}& Positive & True positives (TP) & False negatives (FN) & \\
    \cline{2-4}
    & Negative & False positives (FP) & True negatives (TN) & \\
    \cline{2-4}
    \multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{}\\
  \end{tabular}
  \caption[
    Confusion matrix
  ]{
    Confusion matrix
  }
  \label{tab:methods-confusion-matrix}
\end{table}

Precision is defined as:

\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{Precision} = \frac{\mathrm{TP}}{\mathrm{TP} + \mathrm{FP}}
  \label{eq:methods-precision}
\end{equation}

And recall is defined as:

\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{Recall} = \frac{\mathrm{TP}}{\mathrm{TP} + \mathrm{FN}}
  \label{eq:methods-recall}
\end{equation}

Precision and recall can be used with datasets with class imbalance, i.e.\ if the two labels are not spit evenly across observations.


\subsection{Classical periodogram}
\label{subsec:methods-computational-periodogram}

To detect rhythmicity in time series, I computed the classical periodogram and used a statistical test for rhythmicity based on \textcite{glynnDetectingPeriodicPatterns2006}, described as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Let the data have $\mathcal{G}$ cells.
Let cell $g = 1, \dots{}, \mathcal{G}$ have a time series with $N_{g}$ time points.
The time series is thus denoted $Y_{g}(t) = y_{g}(t_{1}), \dots{}, y_{g}(t_{N_{g}})$.
\item For each time series, I define a range of test frequencies linearly from $\frac{1}{N_{g}}$ to the Nyquist limit (i.e. half the rate of image acquisition, \SI{0.2}{\minute^{-1}}, in this case).

With this definition, I compute the classical periodogram for each time series:
  \begin{equation}
    P_{g}(\omega) = \frac{N_{g}}{2\sigma^{2}} \left|\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} Y_{g} e^{-2\pi it}dt \right|, % check constants, etc
    \label{eq:normalised-periodogram-ar}
  \end{equation}
        where $\sigma^{2}$ is the sample variance of $Y_{g}$.
        In this equation, the periodogram is normalised by the coefficient $N_{g}/2\sigma^{2}$ so that the area under the periodogram is constant across all time series.
        The Lomb-Scargle periodogram is equivalent to the classical periodogram if the time points are equally spaced \parencite{lombLeastsquaresFrequencyAnalysis1976}, as is the case for the vast majority of my data.
\item For each cell $g$, I denote the peak $h_{g} = \max_{j}P_{g}(\omega)$.
I define an effective number of independent frequencies $M = f_{max}N_{g}$ for each time series, where $f_{max}$ is the Nyquist limit \parencite{vanderplasUnderstandingLombScarglePeriodogram2018}.
  I then calculate the $p$-value of testing the null hypothesis that such a peak is due to chance:
  \begin{equation}
    p_{g} = 1 - (1 - e^{-h_{g}})^M
    \label{eq:lsp-pval}
  \end{equation}
  This formula is based on the exponential distribution of the power at a given frequency in the periodogram \parencite{scargleStudiesAstronomicalTime1982}.
\item I order the cells by $p$-values: $p_{(1)} \leq p_{(2)} \leq \dots \leq p_{(\mathcal{G})}$.
      This order thus ranks the cells by oscillation quality.
\item To control the false discovery rate \parencite{benjaminiControllingFalseDiscovery1995}, I find $\hat{k}$ according to:
  \begin{equation}
    \hat{k} = \arg\max_{1 \leq k \leq \mathcal{G}}\{k : p_{(k)} \leq qk/\mathcal{G}\}
    \label{eq:lsp-khat}
  \end{equation}
  where $q$ is a defined false discovery rate.
\item Cells whose $p$-values correspond to $p_{(1)}, p_{(2)}, \dots, p_{(\hat{k})}$ are thus denoted to have statistically significant oscillatory behaviour for the false discovery rate $q$.
\end{enumerate}

Subsequently, the peak of the normalised classical periodogram of each time series was used as a proxy for the quality of oscillation, and therefore, the time series can be ranked according to the height of this peak.


\subsection{Autoregressive model}
\label{subsec:methods-computational-ar}

As an alternative method to detect rhythmicity in time series, I fitted an autoregressive model and used its parameters to compute an analytically-defined periodogram, based on \textcite{jiaFrequencyDomainAnalysis2020}, as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The algorithm relies on fitting a single time series $n(0), n(1), \ldots , n(M-1)$ with an autoregressive model $\mathrm{AR}(P)$ with order $P$:
        \begin{equation}
          \label{eq:ar-model}
          \phi_{0}n_{t} + \phi_{1}n_{t-1} + \phi_{2}n_{t-2} + \ldots + \phi_{P}n_{t-P} = \theta_{0}\epsilon_{t}
        \end{equation}
        where $\epsilon_{t}$ is a white noise satisfying $\langle \epsilon_{t} \rangle = 0$,
        $\phi_{0} = 1$, and
        $\phi_{1}, \ldots , \phi_{P}$ are real numbers such that the complex zeros of the polynomial $\Phi (z) = \sum_{k=0}^{P} \phi_{k}z^{k}$ lie outside the unit circle.
  \item The sample mean of the time series is estimated by:
        \begin{equation}
          \label{eq:ar-mean}
          \langle n \rangle = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{k=0}^{M-1}n(k)
        \end{equation}
  \item The sample autocorrelation function is estimated as:
        \begin{equation}
          \label{eq:ar-acf}
          R_{i} = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{k=0}^{M-1-i}(n(k) - \langle n \rangle)(n(k+i) - \langle n \rangle)
        \end{equation}
  \item The coefficients $\phi_{1}, \ldots , \phi_{P}$ are estimated by solving the Yule-Walker equation:
        \begin{equation}
          \label{eq:ar-yule-walker}
          \begin{bmatrix}
            R_{0} & R_{1} & \dots & R_{P-1} \\
            R_{1} & R_{0} & \dots & R_{P-2} \\
            \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
            R_{P-1} & R_{P-2} & \dots & R_{0}
          \end{bmatrix}
          \begin{bmatrix}
            \phi_{1} \\
            \phi_{2} \\
            \vdots \\
            \phi_{P}
          \end{bmatrix}
          =
          \begin{bmatrix}
            R_{1} \\
            R_{2} \\
            \vdots \\
            R_{P}
          \end{bmatrix}
        \end{equation}
  \item The parameter $\theta_{0}$ is estimated as:
        \begin{equation}
          \label{eq:ar-noise-param}
          \theta_{0}^{2} = R_{0} - \sum_{k=1}^{P}\theta_{k}R_{k}
        \end{equation}
  \item The order $P$ is determined by minimising the Akaike information criterion:
        \begin{equation}
          \label{eq:ar-aic}
          \mathrm{AIC}(P) = \log \theta_{0}^{2}(P) + 2 \frac{P}{M}
        \end{equation}
        where $\theta_{0}(P)$ is the estimated $\theta_{0}$ (equation~\ref{eq:ar-noise-param}) for a specific $P$.
        In this step, $P$ is varied with $1 \leq P \leq 3 \sqrt{M}$, and the optimum order ($P$) is the one that gives the smallest value of $\mathrm{AIC}(P)$
   \item The power spectrum is thus estimated analytically using the parameters found in earlier steps by:
        \begin{equation}
          \label{eq:ar-power-spectrum}
          G(\xi) = \frac{1}{2 \pi} \cdot \frac{\theta_{0}^{2}}{|\sum_{k=0}^{P}\phi_{k}\me^{-ik\xi}|^{2}}, -\pi \leq \xi \leq \pi
        \end{equation}
        where $\xi$ represents frequency.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Cross-correlation function}
\label{subsec:methods-computational-xcf}

To estimate the periodicity of signals and to detect the synchrony between two types of signals, I adapted the cross-correlation function as used in \textcite{pietschDeterminingGrowthRates2023}, as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Let the data have $M$ cells.
        Each cell $i$ in the population of $M$ cells has a time series $x_{1}^{(i)}, \ldots , x_{j}^{(i)}, \ldots , x_{N}^{(i)}$ of quantity $x$ and a time series $y_{1}^{(i)}, \ldots , y_{j}^{(i)}, \ldots , y_{N}^{(i)}$ of quantity $y$.
        Let both time series have a sampling interval of $\Delta t$.
  \item The deviation from the population mean for each time series is computed.
        This population mean is calculated over replicates at each time point.
        The caveat of this calculation is that the signals \emph{must} be out-of-phase, and I ensure this by generating synthetic signals with a random phase.
        Otherwise, the underlying signal will be subtracted from all time series and the cross-correlation of noise will be computed --- this is undesired.
        \begin{equation}
          \delta x_{t}^{(i)} = x_{t}^{(i)} - \frac{1}{M} \sum_{j}x_{t}^{(j)}
          \label{eq:xcf-dmeans-x}
        \end{equation}
        \begin{equation}
          \delta y_{t}^{(i)} = y_{t}^{(i)} - \frac{1}{M} \sum_{j}y_{t}^{(j)}
          \label{eq:xcf-dmeans-y}
        \end{equation}
  \item Based on \textcite{kivietStochasticityMetabolismGrowth2014}, the cross-covariance of the two time series $x$ and $y$ at a time lag of $r\Delta t$, is thus given by:
        \begin{equation}
          C_{xy}^{(i)}(r\Delta t) =
          \begin{cases}
            \frac{1}{N-r} \sum_{t=1}^{N-r} \delta x_{t}^{(i)} \cdot \delta y_{t+r}^{(i)} & \text{if } r \geq 0 \\
            C_{yx}^{(i)}(-r \Delta t) & \text{if } r < 0
          \end{cases}
          \label{eq:xcf-xcov}
        \end{equation}
    \item $C_{xx}^{(i)}(0)$ and $C_{yy}^{(i)}(0)$ thus give the variances of $x$ and $y$.  The cross-correlation is thus given, with normalising by the standard deviation, by:
        \begin{equation}
          R_{xy}^{(i)}(r \Delta t) = \frac{C_{xy}^{(i)}(r \Delta t)}{\sqrt{C_{xx}^{(i)}(0) C_{yy}^{(i)}(0)}}
          \label{eq:xcf-xcf}
        \end{equation}
\end{enumerate}

The autocorrelation of a time series $x$ is thus the cross-correlation of the time series with itself, i.e.\ $R_{xx}^{(i)}(r \Delta t)$.


\subsection{Synthetic oscillations}
\label{subsec:methods-computational-synthetic}

To understand the effect of the shape and noise properties present in biological time series on the cross-correlation function, I emulated such time series by generating synthetic time series using the harmonic (sinusoid) and FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators \parencite{fitzhughImpulsesPhysiologicalStates1961}.

The harmonic oscillator $y(t)$ is defined as the solution of:

\begin{equation}
  \sndif{y}{t} = -\omega^{2}y
  \label{eq:harmonic}
\end{equation}

where the sole parameter $\omega$ represents the angular frequency.
%The solution $y(t) = A \sin(\omega{}t + \phi)$ defines a sinusoidal time series; $A$ is a constant representing amplitude and $\phi$ is a constant representing phase, both determined by initial conditions of the system.


% \begin{figure}
%   \centering
%   \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{fitzhughnagumo_sample.png}

%   }
%   \label{fig:fitzhughnagumo_sample}
% \end{figure}

The FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillator $v(t)$ is defined as a solution of the system:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \ndif{v}{t} &= v - \frac{v^3}{3} - w + RI_{\mathrm{ext}} \\
    \tau \ndif{w}{t} &= v + a - bw
  \end{aligned}

where $RI_{\mathrm{ext}}$, $\tau$, $a$, and $b$ are constant parameters to be determined.
%Fig.\ \ref{fig:fitzhughnagumo_sample} shows an example.

In addition, I emulated noise by generating Gaussian and Gillespie noise.

Gaussian noise was generated by randomly drawing samples from the normal distribution $\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^{2})$.
Here, $\sigma$ denotes the standard deviation of the distribution and thus controls the size of the noise.

Gillespie noise emulates noise from biological systems (Fig.\ \ref{fig:gillespie_noise}).
Gillespie noise was generated using the direct method of the Gillespie algorithm \parencite{gillespieExactStochasticSimulation1977} on the birth-death process model (Appendix~\ref{append:analysis-gillespie}).

The birth-death process is a simple stochastic model used for the modelling of gene expression.
The model describes a species that is produced at a linear birth rate $k_{0}$ and destroyed at a linear death rate $d_{0}$, and is defined by the system of equations~\ref{eq:birth-death-process}:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    R_{1}: \varnothing \ce{ &->[k_{0}] P}\\
    R_{2}: \ce{P &->[d_{0}]} \varnothing
  \end{aligned}
  \label{eq:birth-death-process}
\end{equation}

To produce Gillespie noise, a stochastic simulation employing the direct method of the Gillespie algorithm was performed on the birth-death process model with defined $k_{0}$ and $d_{0}$ parameters.
The final time was defined in such a way that allows the trajectory of the amount of $P$ over time to reach a steady state (Fig.\ \ref{fig:gillespie_trajectory}).
This time varied depending on the $k_{0}$ and $d_{0}$ values, but the final time of \num{1500} was chosen as it was long enough to have the trajectory each steady state for the $k_{0}$ and $d_{0}$ values used in this study.
The latter half of the trajectory was taken and then put on a grid with \num{1000} regularly-spaced time points, equal to the number of time points for the synthetic oscillators (harmonic and FitzHugh-Nagumo).
The time series was then normalised by subtracting the mean ($k_{0}/d_{0}$) and then dividing by $\sqrt{1/d_{0}}$ to create a time series representing Gillespie noise with mean 0 and standard deviation $\sqrt{k_{0}}$ (Fig.\ \ref{fig:gillespie_noise_samples}).
This Gillespie noise thus has a standard deviation of noise amplitude $A = \sqrt{k_{0}/d_{0}}$ and noise timescale $\tau = 1/d_{0}$ --- in other words, the rate parameters of the birth-death process control the noise properties of this Gillespie noise.

To evaluate the quality of oscillatory time series in a dataset and to indirectly measure the amplitude of the oscillations, I computed a signal-to-noise ratio for each time series.
%Because the information about the amplitude of the oscillations was removed when they were filtered using the high-pass Butterworth filter, a different measure is needed.
Assuming a constant noise introduced by the combination of intrinsic noise (stochasticity in biochemical processes) and extrinsic noise (variations introduced by measurement instruments), a low signal-to-noise ratio suggests a low oscillation amplitude, and the reverse is true for a high signal-to-noise ratio.

The signal-to-noise ratio can be defined as follows:

Given a time series $x(t) = x_{t_{1}}, x_{t_{2}}, \ldots, x_{t_{N}}$, the normalised classical periodogram (Fourier spectrum) is given by

\begin{equation}
  P(\omega) = \frac{N}{2\sigma^{2}} \left|\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(t) e^{-2\pi it}dt \right|, % check constants, etc
  \label{eq:normalised-periodogram}
\end{equation}

where $N$ is the number of time points in $x$ and $\sigma^{2}$ is the sample variance of $x$.
The periodogram $P$ is defined as a function of the angular frequency $\omega$.

A critical frequency $\omega_{c}$ is then defined to divide signal and noise --- that is, very high-frequency components of the periodogram correspond to noise and lower-frequency components correspond to the meaningful oscillations.

The signal to noise ratio $r_{s/n}$ (Fig.\ \ref{fig:analysis-snr}) is thus defined as

\begin{equation}
  r_{s/n} = \frac{s}{n}
  \label{eq:snr}
\end{equation}

where the signal $s$ is defined as

\begin{equation}
  s = \int_{0}^{\omega_{c}} P(\omega) d\omega
  \label{eq:signal}
\end{equation}

and the noise $n$ is defined as

\begin{equation}
  n = \int_{\omega_{c}}^{\infty} P(\omega) d\omega
  \label{eq:noise}
\end{equation}

In this thesis, I define $\omega_{c} = \SI{0.018}{\minute^{-1}}$ because this frequency is lower than the frequencies of all oscillations of flavin autofluorescence I observed in my experiments.
