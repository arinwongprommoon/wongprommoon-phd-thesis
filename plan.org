* Title
* Abstract
* Lay summary
* Section: (Literature) Yeast metabolic cycle
** Introduction to biological rhythms
** Definition and description of yeast metabolic cycle
- Context of discovery
- Introduce chemostat vs single-cell discussions
- Biochemical and metabolic aspects
  - Metabolites
  - Mobilisation of macromolecules, storage molecules
- Transcription aspects
- Cell biology aspects, including cell division cycle
** Yeast metabolic cycle under perturbations
- Nutrient perturbations
- Key deletion strains shed light on mechanism
** Big picture: a nutrient sensor than entrains the cell division cycle?
** In other organisms
- Other yeasts
- Other organisms: bacteria, mammalian cells
** Disputes and unresolved questions
- Limitations of chemostat
- Do cells individually generate the metabolic cycle or is a diffusible chemical responsible for synchrony?
- Populations of cells?
* Section: (Literature) Flavins and flavoproteins
** Introduction to cellular autofluorescence
** Biochemical basis of flavins and flavoproteins
- Flavins are molecules with a certain aromatic moiety than can undergo redox reactions.
- Flavoproteins have FAD and FMN as co-factors.
** Studies on global flavin changes in response to perturbations
- How oxygen and nutrient changes affect flavins and other autofluorescence
** Description of key flavoproteins and their roles
- (Sort by abundance)
** Flavins and flavoproteins in the yeast metabolic cycle
- Easy-to-measure metabolic readout, linked to many biochemical processes
*** Review of chemostat and single-cell studies that use flavin
*** Do flavin cycles suggest cycling of lipid stores?
* Section: Single-cell analysis of yeast metabolic cycles
** Relationship between the metabolic cycle and cell division cycle: synchrony and autonomy
- Synchrony: in permissive conditions, they synchronise.
- Autonomy: other conditions make it clear that the metabolic cycle is independent of the cell division cycle
** Effect of carbon source and perturbations on the yeast metabolic cycle
- Fermentable vs non-fermentable carbon source
- (Nitrogen sources?)
- Perturbations: starvation, bulk addition of substrate, feast-and-famine
** Effect of gene deletions on the yeast metabolic cycle
*** (Literature) Review of chemostat-based studies that employ gene deletions
- Categorise by system affected?
** (Modelling the yeast metabolic cycle)
- Discuss difficulty of having a fine-grained model: too many unknowns with this biological system
*** (Literature) Modelling chemostat-based studies
- Metabolic responses to environment
- Cell communication
*** Coarse-grained, phenomenological model
** Reconciling single-cell studies with chemostat-based studies
- (Mostly interpretation and discussion)
* Section: Analysis of oscillatory time series
** Classification: is my time series oscillatory?
*** (Literature) Rhythmicity detection for biological data
- Compare and contrast methods
- Highlight challenges with large datasets of noisy biological data
*** Machine learning approaches to classification
** Characterisation: I have one time series -- what properties does it have?
*** (Literature) Periods, phases, amplitudes
*** Combining methods to get a picture of periodicity
** Clustering: I have many time series -- what are their relationships to each other?
*** (Literature)
*** Machine learning approaches to clustering
- Featurisaion -- decisions to make
- Clustering approaches and algorithms -- compare and contrast
* Methods
** Strains and media
** Single-cell microfluidics
** Segmentation, extraction, post-processing
** Time series analysis
* Conclusions
* Appendices
